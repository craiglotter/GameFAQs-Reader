GameFAQs Reader

GameFAQs Reader is used for the organised viewing of game faq text files. The application parses all the game folders in the FAQs folder found in its startup path and lists the folder names as a list of games. Each folder then holds the game faq in a .txt format as well as an jpg image file (named after the folder).
