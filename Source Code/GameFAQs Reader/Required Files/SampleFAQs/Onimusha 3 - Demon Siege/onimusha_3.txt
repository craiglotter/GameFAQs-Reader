                                   INTRO
===============================================================================
This game is great.
Once you play it, (maybe) you do not want to stop.
Collect all weapons and finished the Training Mode.
Master the Special Moves.
Well, it may contains a bit of repetition recipe :).
It would be nice if the gameplay/Battle System is something in common to the
Vagrant Story or Legend of Dragoon or "Devil May Cry". I wish for it :)~

What is a Japanese-US version?
Based on the Japanese walkthrough, I got a chance to play the US version.
Everything seems to be the same only a few things are belongs to the other side
The naming is automatically as stated in the US/English version.
I am writing this US version in order to clarify confuse things and
to give you all what you want; the complete walkthrough :)

Currently I have already translated this walkthrough into a English version
up to Episode 10. Let's hope I can complete my task within the next week :).

I still need helps for the Japanese version;
could you please let me know the Romaji style for all the naming in the
Japanese version? Also the enemy list if possible?
I will put the Romaji side by side with the English naming if possible
so that this walkthrough will be at it's best to serve you all :).

P.S.
I also put a number on each EcoSpirit I found to make it easier to trace back
and to recount it :).

===============================================================================
                              HINTS AND TIPS
===============================================================================
1. Upgrading weapons etc will grant you only good things.

2. Ako will help you reach items out of your reach.
   Get close to the item and press Circle to let Ako get it for you.

3. Counterattack is very useful to get more Experience, Souls and Energy.

4. Complete all the Puzzle Box and Training.
   You will get useful items and unlock secrets.

5. Use Key Item such as Door Key from the Menu Screen.

6. You cannot skip the first time cut scene, however once you have passed the
   chapter/episode, you will be able to skip.
   An example is when you load your save data.

7. Basic Combos:
   Jacques 1: Grab, shoot 2x, throw enemy, approach the enemy and shoot 3/4x.
   Jacques 2: Hit the enemy 3x, press Down on direction pad + Square 3x
              to perform multi kick, once they are on the ground, shoot 3/4x.
              And if the enemy is slow, you can continue shoot at him
              as many times as you want.
   Jacques 3: Grab, shot 2/3x, kick (Down pad + Circle), Magic Skill (Triangle)
   Samanosuke 1: Hit 3-5x, once they are on the ground, stabs by pressing [].
   Samanosuke 2: Hit 3x with [] then hit Triangle.

8. You can escape enemy's grab by rotating the L3 analog stick.

9. You can get up faster by rotating your L3 analog stick.

10.By holding down the charge power and be at a certain spot, Ako will let you
   know if there is an item to pick up. That is your search engine :)

11.Press Down pad and X to step back.

12.When your HP is in critical, defeating some enemies might give you
   some HP refills.

13.Ways of Counterattack:
   a. Block and quickly tap []. You will see an aura from Ako if you
      block at the right timing (almost get hit).
   b. Just before you are hit, avoid and press [] without blocking.
      If you are a very lucky guy, button mashing for [] and/or R1
      continuously and sometimes, you will perform the counterattack.
   c. Hold Down R1, circle movement in front of the enemy
      and press Square when the attack is almost hit you.
      You may use directional pad when charging to move in circle and
      then press Square at the right timing.
   d. Tapping the R1 once/twice when avoiding hit and
      press Square to Counterattack.
   e. Persuade the enemy to attack by running in front of/near him.
      Wait until he is beginning to attack then quickly hit []
      to perform heavy attack, thus performing counterattack.
      (Heavy attack is perform when you are running for about
      3 seconds and hit the [] button)
   f. Rare thing to happen is when you are hitting an enemy/enemies and you
      are still holding down the R1 button, you will be performing
      Multiple Counterattacks!

14. When your Purple Energy is full that means you will get additional live
    and your body will be invulnerable until the shining bar is gone.
    At that time your power and magic has increased significantly to the limit.
    It is the Onimusha form. However, your life bar is only 25% after changing
    back to human form.
    After that, if, you have been defeated again however you still keep
    the Black Revive Tool, which means you will get one more additional life
    without Onimusha form, full life bar.
    And again, if you still keep the Brown Revive Doll, you will gain another
    additional live with full health bar.
    That means you get 3(Three) additional lives plus 1(one) original live
    for the total of 4(four) lives!!!!.
    All right, just got one more Brown Revive Doll for Samanosuke in the
    Dark Realm on Episode 8.
    More good news, another Brown Revive Doll for Jacques in the
    Dark Realm on Episode 8.
    Now the total lives would be for the total of 6(six) lives!!!!!.

15.When Jacques pick up items such as arrows, he can teleport it to
   Samanosuke using the Teleporto (Purple Magic Mirror) on episode 6.
   You can teleport almost anything, except for some individual key items.

16.Notice that you cannot hit the enemy below when you are at the deck stairs
   on the ship. Oh well.

17.Dropped items will disappear after some time if you do not pick it up
   right away.

18.When Ako pick up item, it will not disappear as long as you do not enter the
   next door.

19.There are some false EcoSpirits.
   When you check on the Menu Screen, the one you have just picked up
   has disappeared without a trace :)~.
   According to Mickey magante, mickey_ichiro@yahoo.com,
   Capcom is purposedly design the Eco Spirits to disappear on their journey
   back to nature, Please read the submission no. 11 for a clearer view.

20.Spare some arrows on your journey. You are going to need it.

21.Do not forget there is a Side Mission to complete (Episode 8).
   Please read Miscellaneous section for further details.

22.When you need to absorb, PRESS AND HOLD DOWN the O button.

23.There are 3(three) Dark Realms on a new game and it is applicable to
   both Jacques and Samanosuke. So, totally there are 6(six) Dark Realms
   with unique items inside each of it. Be sure NOT TO MISS IT!
   I have already added info about it on the walkthrough.
   Also, I have completed 3 eyes in the Dark realm.
   (Sealed White Wind, Sealed Purple Lightning, Sealed Red Flame)
   Break Demon Emerald and Break Demon Purple Jade is an item to unlock
   Sealed Chests to get useful items such as Brown Revive Doll.
   Dark Realm 1: Episode 6  -Underwater Temple- [Sealed Purple Lightning]
                                                [Sealed White Wind]
   Dark realm 2: Episode 8  -Mount St. Michel-  [Sealed Red Flame]
                                                [Purple Haori/Vest]
   Dark realm 3: Episode 12 -Back to Nippon 1582- [Oni Musou]
                                                  [Bishamon Sword]

24.Give priority to use Herbs. Tonics and other HP replenish items are limited
   in quantity. You can collect Herbs also when defeating enemies.

25.The location and use of Vest/Haori:
   Blue Vest: Episode 2 -Samanosuke is back, pick it up inside the second house
   Use-->Absorb spirits faster.
   Red Vest: Episode 3 -Inside the second room, at the end of the small alley-
   Use-->More Red Spirits from kills (No more Yellow and Blue Spirits!).
   Green Vest: Episode 4 -At the Backyard of the main store-
   Use-->Able to absorb spirits from live Genma.
   White Vest: Episode 5 -Inside the Notre Dame, opposite the altar to the end
   Use-->Heals you when standing still.
   Yellow Vest: Episode 6 -Inside the Yellow Door on the upper level-
   Use-->When attacking Red Spirits come out.
   Orange Vest: Episode 8 -Glide to the top of the castle from the main door-
   Use-->Show enemy's life and Issen moment.
   Purple Vest: Episode 8 -Samanosuke on the Dark realm 2, Green Warp-
   Use-->Decrease the use of magic when using Sword magic.
   Black Vest: Complete the Issen Training at the save point.
   Use-->All Issen :)~

26.I have calculated everything and if you follow this walkthrough correctly,
   you will get the Onimusha ranking once you completed this game, even if
   you miss the 'Less than 6 hours' but as long as you get the Black Haori :)
   For more details, let me copy and paste the info from Kouli and Raimia on
   the Message Boards:
   From Kouli:

   In 6 different aspects, have 41+ points to get Onimusha ranking,
   on easy, you need   50 points.
   Less than 6 hours                + 10 points
   170000 Souls                     + 10 points
   2300 Kills                       + 10 points
   600+ Issen                       + 10 points
   Hidden Stuff -Get all 6 stuffs = + 10 points

   Hidden Stuffs are:
   1. 3 Sealed Jade (for Onimusha 1, Samanosuke's weapons)
   2. Bishamon Sword
   3. Oni Musou
   4. Black Haori for Ako

   From Raimia:
   a little more detail about the realm items.
   1. 3 Sealed Jade                 + 10 points for each
   2. Bishamon Sword                + 30 points
   3. Oni Musou                     + 30 points
   4. Purple Haori for Ako          + 10 points

   100 points   = 10 points
   70-99 points =  6 points
   50-69 points =  4 points
   40-49 points =  3 points
   20-39 points =  2 points
   19 and below =  1 point

   And what is the reward for collecting the Onimusha ranking?
   Is it all worthful for the (Michelle's) towel? :)~

27.Bishamon Sword and Oni Musou:
   Do you think there is a special function of this sword?
   Yes, you are right.
   I found out that when using this sword you are semi-invincible!!!
   When you are using the Triangle button, the enemies will not have
   a chance to hit you at all!!! (if you hit them first of course :).
   What I mean is the sword is so powerful that you will finish most of the
   enemies with one Triangle slash or a few slashes for the boss’s type.
   You can also combine a 3/4 hits [] with the Triangle button for
   the final hit. This combination means a semi-invincible combo.
   Imagine this on the training session :)~.
   This is what happens to Jacques when he is equipped with the Oni Musou.
   To get a clearer view, when you use the Triangle move, you are invincible!!!

28.For the English version, you will get your SPS15+G after saving Henry in
   the Research Center, later on the Episode 7.

29.Keep changing weapons when doing magic attack.
   That means you will get more chances to do magic attacks and when the
   magic bar is refilling, it is automatically applicable for all weapons :)~

30.Trainings for Samanosuke:       Trainings for Jacques:
   1. Guard -T1-                   1. (Guard)
   2. Draw Weapon -T2-             2. (Draw Weapon)
   3. Archery -T3-                 3. Oni-Bind Throw -T1-
   4. Charge Attack -T4            4. Oni Bind-Bind Move -T2-
   5. Deflect Critical -T5-        5. (Deflect Critical)
   6. Chain Critical -T6-          6. (Chain Critical)
   7. Ten Point Slash -T7-         7. (Ten Point Slash)
   8. Oni

   All Trainings consist of 3 (three sessions);
   -Beginner, Intermediate, Advance.
   I list out all the trainings in order of appearance :)
   However, both Samanosuke and Jacques is capable of completing it
   at any time. Except for the Oni-Bind Throw and Oni-Bind-Bind Move which is
   belongs to Jacques.

31.I suggest to upgrade the Oni Gauntlet first to increase functions then
   the weapons from the highest rank weapon.

32.Shortcut for the current map at anytime: Hold down L2 button for 2 seconds.

You cannot open the sealed door, yet.
You need to go back to the Church.

If you examine the Dark Parchment you have just picked up,
you will notice there is a connection between the four statues in the Church
with the Darkness surrounding the statues.
Now you need to visit the four of them one by one, starting from the
statue with only one candlestand burning and so on.

You have to absorb the Darkness from those statues in orderly fashion.
->Please hold down the O button to absorb the Darkness<-
(Thanks to Steve Tan, desho55@yahoo.com for asking about a more elaborate
explanation on how to absorb the Darkness)

Finally, the jewel on the mouth is shining brightly.
Approach it to obtain [Kuga].

Go back to the sealed door inside the underground.
Open it with the Kuga equipped.
Another blades trap is waiting for you. As usual, go to the left.

*******************************************************************************
Upgrade advise -Samanosuke-: Kuga to level 2

You will be in a place where the 'Nan Ban Ship' harbors. Remember Jacques?
But no sign of him because this is in a different time folding :).
Ako is unable to warp to Jacques either.

On the left side of the upper deck, you will find [Oni Med Level 1]x1.
At the center of the upper deck, if you use Archery, the arrow will point out
to a certain direction on the upper-left corner of your screen
(you should see the steel bar with holes on your feet).
Use your arrow TWO TIMES and Ako will get you *EcoSpirit no.18!*
Thanks to Fabian Tan for informing about this finding although I have updated
the walkthrough itself, but Fabian is eligible for a Full Credit for her
kind assistance :).

Get inside the Main Door.

*Undersea Temple* (Save Point)

On your right there is a chest contains [Tablet:Time Fold].

The main idea is to teleport Key Items between Samanosuke and Jacques.
When one of them get the key item (Color Disk), transfer it using the
Teleporto/Time Folder by activating the Purple Mirror next to the save point.
Opposite to the Purple Mirror/Time Folder, there is the Unlimited MP Refill,
but you can only use it starting from Jacques.

At the center platform, There are three Mini/Elemental Towers.
Each tower needs a (color) Disk -Yellow, Blue and red- to fully operate.
-Each color is corresponding to their elemental power-
It is now your mission job to find the three Disks and place it on the
correspondence tower.

Take the staircase and grab the [Yellow Disk] from the tower on the right.
Use the Time Folder and deliver the Yellow Disk to Jacques.
Yes, you can send and receive other items to and from between both of them.
And you can switch character by using it at any time.

(Samanosuke can get inside the Yellow door, however he cannot continue further
because of the flood)

Jacques comes out from the ship, in the year of 1582.
Place the Yellow Disk on its original place.
Now you can get through the Yellow Door.

Get inside, use the Glide to get to the next room.
Before you enter, notice on the right there is a Dragon Decoration
on the wall with one Horn only. You need to find the other one.

Inside the room, there is one chest contains [Ancient Slab] and [Time Lab 2].
Once you picked up the Key Item, enemies show up.
There is also a Pedestal surronded by Red light. Inside the Pedestal is the
Red Disk (the color of the light determines the color of the Disk).
You cannot touch it now, not yet.

Do not worry wasting your MP because you can always absorb MP from the
Unlimited MP refill near the first Save Point.
(The first time, only Jacques can take advantage of the Unlimited MP Refill)

Do not forget to pick up [D Critical Training Scroll] from th upper-left corner
Go back to the save point and complete the Training.

Training Scroll :
-Jacques - Push the [] button just before an enemy attack for the special
           "Critical" move.
           Works better when executed ~while side-stepping an attack~

Weapon Used: Lightning Spear (For better range, faster charging, etc)
I recommend upgrading your armor to level 3.
           (No Souls to absorb this time)
           Remember, there are several ways to achieve counterattack;
           -Hold Down R1, circle movement in front of the enemy
            and press Square when the attack is almost hit you.
           -Tapping the R1 once/twice when avoiding hit and
            press Square to Counterattack.
           -Avoiding and press Square during the enemy's attack/almost hit
            (this may the best solution in this mission).
           -If you are a very lucky guy, button mashing for R1 and []
            continuously and sometimes, you will perform the counterattack.
           -Persuade the enemy to attack by running in front of/near him.
            Wait until he is beginning to attack then quickly hit []
            to perform heavy attack, thus performing counterattack.
            (Heavy attack is perform when you are running for about
            3 seconds and hit the [] button)

Trick: This may take more time to beat the enemy.
*Hold down left/right directional pad when holding down R1 to move in circle
 and press Square at the right timing when the enemy is start attacking.
 Up and down pad to move forward and backward.
 You move faster when using directional pad.
 This way, when you fail to perform the counter attack, your whip will
 grab the enemy and lock his attack and movement (100% safe).
 Press X button to cancel grabbing and keep repeating the process
 until you get the result.
 It is better to move in a circle with the enemy at the center area.

Reward: [ ]x1.
Beginner    : Defeat 7 enemies. Easy+
              (Soldiersx2, Four Feetsx2, Lizardsx2, Slimyx1)

Intermediate: Defeat 7 enemies. Medium.
              (Ninja, Four Hands, Ninja + Four Hands, Four Hands, Big Club,
              Chain Ball)

Advance     : Defeat  enemies. Hard. This one is a real a pain in the a** >_<.
              (Big Sword, Big Ape, Genma Soldier?, Genma High Soldier?,
              Big Sword + Big Ape, )

Go ride the capsule to the upper level.
Inside the chest, you get [Sea Temple Map].
To defeat the enemy above, you may throw the small pillar or use charge + X
when near to them.

Opposite to the capsule there is a Puzzle Door.
Place the Ancient Slab to the empty shelf.
Puzzle Time.

5 X 4 + 3 + 1 - 2 = 22 or
5 X 4 + 1 + 3 - 2 = 22.

Forward and you will see the Earth Sealed Door.
Turn right and open one chest to release a Glide outside.

Go to upper platform using the Glide and turn right to get [Oni Tortoise].
Open one chest at the opposite center contains a [L Dragon Horn].
Do not forget to use Ako to get [Medicine]x1 on the upper-left shelf
to the left of the big door.

Get back to the Earth Sealed Door. This time turn left.
At the end of the left turn, wait for a moment and a strange guy will
glide down on a rope and still hanging. Choose yes two times to answer him.

Start: In the Main Warp Zone, you will automatically get [Dark Realm Scroll].
       Defeat all enemies in the Main area.
1. Pink : Fight three Big Clubs. Try to perform Deflect Critical with your lvl 3
          All 3 of them will be counterattacked one by one in a lightning zap.
          Cool. Defeat another two of them. Absorb Souls from the Souls Statue.
2. Blue : Defeat enemies.
3. Green: Defeat enemies.
4. Pink : Defeat enemies and pick up [Thunder Seal]
Exit through the Center Warp.

Go back to the lower level. Get outside the room with the Pedestal.
On your left, there is a door with Dragon Decoration with one horn only.
Place your L Dragon Horn to activate the mechanism. The water is draining.
Now you can go down/up the stairs or at least it is accessible for Samanosuke.

Switch character to Samanosuke.
Get inside the Yellow Door. Down the stairs, pick up [Secret Med] from
chest at the upper-left corner.

Go up the staircase and open the only door at the end corner.
Pick up [Blue Disk] from the Pedestal.

Boss fight: Genma Mori Ranmaru. -Easy+-
Weapon used: Wind Katana.
-Get close to him. Hit him. Charge your level up if possible.
-Seldom, when you are still holding down the R1 when hitting him,
 you will be performing Multiple Counterattack! (3 times in a row in
 charge up level :)
-When he throws fireball, avoid or block or throw it back by guarding.
-Your arrow can eliminate his fireball.
-When Genma Mori Ranmaru is absorbing his broken energy/souls, combo him.
 If possible, at the end of the combo use (Wind) Magic.
 Or just use magic for a better chance to hit.
-As long as there is still Souls/Energies to absorb,
 take that to your advantage.
-You can use arrow to damage him and then he will try to absorb his souls,
 giving you chance to do more/greater damage.
-That's it.

Wait, this is a very easy way to finish off Ranmaru (secret tips):
-Always absorb!!! within a safe range.
 Mori Ranmaru will then releases his Yellow Fireball, perform counterattack.
 It will turn into a Energy (Yellow) Soul.
-Absorb the Energy Soul. Once you get it, Ranmaru will be angry and therefore
 more Yellow Fireball to come. Counterattack all of them to get Engergy Souls.
-When Ranmaru is absorbing back his Energy Souls, give him a direct hit/combo
 with magic preferred or just a direct charge hit.

Teleport the Blue Disk and switch character to Jacques.

Place the Blue Disk on the Lightning Tower, center platform.
The correspondence door will open. Go in.
(Remember, you can switch character at any time)

Open the door at the end.
Once you are in this room, to your right is another Dragon Decoration
with only one horn. Again, you need to find the other pair.

Continue forward and use one Glide then pick up your new weapon
[Hyosai]. Now you can smash enemies on the ground and use Ice magic.

Retrace to the sealed door and open it. Inside there is a
wingless Oni Firefly (Glide) on the floor. Nothing you can do about it.
Your job is done for now.

Go back to where you found Hyosai just now.

On the left outside, next to the staircase,
pick up [Chain Critical Training Scroll].

Inside the unsealed room, at the end you will get [Firefly Wings].
Get upstairs and open the door. Now you can smash those boxes.
Pick up [R Dragon Horn]. Now, on this part, when you smash those boxes to
get the Dragon Horn, I once obtain one false EcoSpirit,
which is I think a glitch just like the one I get on the episode 5
(when you smashed the bin on the right :).

Get downstairs, find the Dragon Decoration.
Activate it using the R Dragon Horn. Now you can get out from that door.
Move your way to the Save Point.

       Mecha Demon 2, Ten Slash Training Scroll, Oni Jewelx1.
*******************************************************************************

You are now controlling Michelle Auberry/Aubert.
Your first weapon is SPS15+S. This is a short-range weapon.
Ako is not with you so you need to pick up items/drop items by yourself.
Open the chest on the left for [Soul Bracelet].
Now you can absorb souls from the defeated Genma.

You can get into the sewer and get wet, yes you need to go there to get
your new weapon. Get back to where Samanosuke cut off the metal string to
drop down the giant ball on Episode 3 (get up the ladder on the end of the
corner). Pick up [Grenade]x10.
---(In the Japanese version though, you should get [SPS15+G].
That is a long range Grenade Launcher :))---

*******************************************************************************
All right guys, I received a lot of emails regarding this SPS15+G and those
who did not get this baby at the exact place as stated on the Japanese
walkthrough.
The reason is because they are playing a different version, namely the
US version. That is why they get the new weapon on a different place.
I received some emails informing that you can get the SPS15+G after saving
Henry at the end of episode 7 in the Research Center.
So do not worry, you will get your weapon as promised :)~
*******************************************************************************

Care to join a field trip?
Get back all the way to the city and get to the top on the tower where
Samanosuke fight the Mecha Robot on Episode 1.
You will not get much trouble with the hi-tech Grenade Launcher on your hands.
(Not suitable for the US version :)~

Route back to the Church (Notre Dame).
Retrace all the way to the underground, then to where Samanosuke met
Guildenstern (before using the Time Machine).
She will meet two Big Swords. Please use grenade :) R1 + Triangle.
And a hidden room shows up. Take out the [Paris Report] from the bookshelf.
Ako has finally come to you seeking help for Samanosuke.
And Anry/Henri is somewhere with Samanosuke, get caught.

In the Zoo, walk up the staircase on the right screen and open a chest
in the corner contains [First-Aid Kit].

Important Note: Please use the Assault Riffle and equip the Yellow Vest
                for the best Souls Collecting result :).
                Thanks to Sheeperstar Mary-Killa for the info.

Get on to a new screen, destroy the bin on the right to get *EcoSpirit no.20*.
Move forward and some enemies will show up, nothing you can’t handle of.
On the left corner, before the bridge, there is a box contains [Grenadex10].
On the right area, there is a save point.

*East Section of Zoo* (Save Point)

Pick up [Zoo Flyer] on the right-end floor.

Go to the left, pass the bridge. Right after the bridge, on the right side,
use Ako to open a box to get [First-Aid Kit].

On the left side there is a locked big door.

At the end of the road, destroy one bin to get *EcoSpirit no.21*.
Get inside the door at the end of the road, and it is a bit dark.
Use your grenade to light it up a bit.
Inside the window case there is a box contains [First-Aid Kit].
You have to use Ako to open it.
Remember, there is a Sealed Door in this room.

Get out from the next door.
On the upper-left corner, there is a chest contains [First-Aid Kit].

Shoot a bin at the straight end to get *EcoSpirit no.22*
and open a chest at the opposite corner to receive [Zoo Map].

Get inside the door on the left.
Move to the left and pick up [Mecha Demon 1] in front of a big gate.
You cannot open the big gate, not now.

Continue to the left, shoot the big pot to get *EcoSpirit no.23*.

Get down the ladder to the bottom.
Approach the four handles to operate the gate.
1. Operate the Left handle and defeat one Big Ape.
2. Operate the Mid Left handle to get [Boat Key].
3. Operate the Mid Right handle and defeat one Big Ape.
4. Operate the Right handle to get your new weapon [SPS15+R].
   It is a type of sniper riffle, but is not effective for short range
   combat, especially when the power is less compare to the Grenade launcher.

Open the big gate upstairs to shortcut your way back.

Route back to the East Section Save Point, continue forward,
turn left at the end, down the stairs and onto the boat on the river.
Use the Small Key to on the Control Box.
(You can use this boat to go back and forward)

We have arrived. Up the stairs and move to the Save Point.

Go through it. You will meet Anry/Henri. Clean up some mess.

On the upper-right top corner (opposite to Anry/Henri),
there is *EcoSpirit no.26* for the total of seven in episode 7 :).

IMPORTANT:

Next to the save point is a door to the boss.
Boss fight: Guildenstern.
Difficulty: Easy+.
Weapon Used: Hyosai.
-He is flying, so you need to wait for him to get lower.
 Of course during the fight you are allowed to use arrows of any kind.
-He will then summon his minion.
 If you beat down the minion, he will revive it, and get him self lower.
 His heart is glowing red. That is your best chance to hit him hard.
 If you use Battle Axe, you can charge it to the highest level.
 Wait until he is lower enough, then release your charge move.
 It will give him enough damage and give you secure. Also you will hit
 the minion. Three-in-one move.
-When you hit the minion, some times they will give you Health Energy.
 You do not need to use Health Items actually.
-Once Guildenstern feel angry, he will release another minion.
 Use the same strategy, only be more careful.
-Repeat the process and you will be fine.
 This is a long battle. That is why you need to get Health Energy from
 the minions using the charge up move.
 Unless you want to use the Health Items from the Menu Screen.
-Once a while he will throw his weapon down to you, but it is predictable.
-When you beat him the first time, he will use a Sand Time Revive Tool.
 So you need to beat him one more time. Not bad for practicing your skill.
 You will beat him definitely, without any problem.

the save point. On the most left part of the wall, there is some kind of
gears. Now activate the handle. The Gears are working, ups,

Now, get back to business.
Get your way back to the Yellow Steel Door.
Inside there is a big strange Green Ball shape, hanging on the center.
This room is some kind of a lab.
Some magicians are here too.

There is a black hole on the floor at the end.
Next to it there is the [Time Lab 4].

SAVE first before you try to save those civilians :)

Retrace to the locked door on the second level after using the bridge.
Use the two Glides to get to the bridge, and the third Glide
will get you to the locked door.
Or, another way is, to move down the staircase and turn left when
you see a open door on the left near the exit door.
Use the Red Key to open the door.

Inside, slave people are working hard monitored by Heihachi's partner
-Vega Donna-.

Open the chest on the upper-left corner to get [Medicine]x1.

calling for your help. Do not let him die.

Go all the way down to the train area. Use the Door Key to open the locked door
You are going to save the three of them.

Pick up [Genma Plant] from the floor.
Use Ako to open a box containing [Secret Med].
(There is a chest behind those boxes)

Get out. Approach the right wing of the back yard.
There is a place to grow plant seeds.
Grow your Plant Seed into one of the square.
The fourth square from the top left (next to the already planted).

Switch to Samanosuke.
Let him crawl down the tree.
Ako will automatically get you the *EcoSpirit no.31*

Get inside the door, smash those boxes and open the chest behind it
to get the [Iron Gear].

Smash the other boxes to get [Medicine]x1 and *EcoSpirit no.32* and

Pick up [French Note] from the shelf on the left.
Go back to the save point area, place the Iron Gear.
Activate the handle to open the center gate.
D*** the handle is now broken! >_<

Ask help from Jacques in the year 1582 where the handle is still in
good condition :).
Do not forget to teleport the Iron Gear to Jacques.
Operate the handle successfully.

Get inside.
Pick up [Vega's Diary] on the floor.
Defeat one Giant Flower. Open a chest behind it to get [Secret Med]x1.

Get inside the left door and take to a passageway to downstairs.

Thanks to Cirio (Cirio@rome.com) for reminding me that the code will keep
changing for a new game or a new game plus. Good job.

Get out of the castle.

Boss Fight:
Weapon Used: Chigo level 3.
-He is pretty much the same as the Boss on Episode 6.
-Except that he has more HP, a little bit more aggressive and no more
 Glides to escape. You need to time your run wisely.
-Release him from his ARMORS!
-You are allowed to use arrows.
-Do not get too close all the time.
 However, after successfully escaping his charging attack you need to
 approach him and it is advisable to use your charge up attack often and
 continuously. He is tough, but believe me, when you use the charge up attack
 level 2/3 frequently, he will not get a chance to do more damage on you.

Episode 9: Oni Mansion
Items: EcoSpirit no.34-35, Forest 1, Biwa Map,
       Medicinex5 (Additional 1 Medicine if you choose the top-left continent),
       Secret Medx2 (Additional 1 Secret Med if you choose the top-right path),
       Oni Mansion Book, Oni Army Book, Oni Army Orb, Azuchi Area Map.
*******************************************************************************

Start with Jacques.
Get out the room through the only door.
Trash some enemies outside.
Break the box in front of you to get *EcoSpirit no.34*.
Pick up [Forest 1] at further left corner.

Use the Glide to the other side and open the next door.

Cut scene.

The reunion of the three heroes.
Samanosuke will accompany you one more time.
Now this is the right time to finish your Training lessons, if you have not.

*Lake Biwa* (Save Point)

First continent:
Smash the box to place a Glide.
Now instead of gliding around, which Samanosuke cannot catch up with
Jacques, he will pull the iceberg in the direction of the Glide.
Smash on the box to place one Glide.
More Glides coming up when you defeat the enemies.

Second continent:
Open the chest on the right side to get [Biwa Map].
Use Ako to get [Medicine]x1 from the out of reach chest on the right side.
Next is a ice platform with weight sensitivity. When the heavy Big Ape
is walking on top of it, the platform will goes down.
Defeat one or two of them and you will be on your way.

Ahead, there is a fork.
The top-left one and the top-right one.
As usual, find the Glides and you will be save and sound.
Press and hold R1 + Circle to smash enemy in the air (Birds).

*If you choose the top-left one, you will get [Medicine]x1.
 Third Continent:
 Another fork.
 If you go straight there is another platform just like the previous one.
 Kill the two Big Apes, and get the Medicine from the chest at the end.
 Now, go back to the fork and ride the other iceberg on the right side.
 Please note there are two Big Apes carrying one Glide each.
 You have to charge up your weapon and perform combo in order to defeat them
 in certain time. If you fail you cannot get the Glide placed and the
 iceberg will crash but not to the fatality.
 That is it. No more bonus item.

*If you choose the top-right one, you will get [Secret Med]x1.
 You will arrive at the West-side island. Clear some enemies.
 There is a Glide to a deserted island. Jacques alone will go there
 and pick up the Secret Med. Easy, right.
 Now get back to the West-side island and get onto the next iceberg
 to get you into the Trap House.
 But I warn you, it is not a very safe path to cross to.

*Front of Oni Mansion* (Save Point)

Finish all the Trainings if you have not.

The Young Samanosuke and the Old Samanosuke is becoming one, Oni-Samanosuke

Samanosuke's final form is an Oni while Nobunaga's is a Genma
(thanks to  ).

The Oni versus the Genma part 1. -Very Easy-
Clue: O** M****
*Jacques need only to whip Nobunaga's *** a few times to win this battle?

The Oni versus the Genma part 2. -Average-
--Well, at first, I did not want to spoil you with this one, but since
  it has been a few months and I bet you all know how to beat that ****
  Nobunaga, then please allow me to share a piece of my scroll--

Important:
*Remember that you can still use HP replenish items from the Menu Screen.

*First Form:
 Goal: Absorb souls to achieve the Oni form (enable you to defeat Nobunaga).
 -Directly/quickly get close to Nobunaga, destroy the satellites by 4 hits,
  you may need to retreat a bit and then absorb the souls.
 -When he is releasing laser beams (it is actually a piece of cake),
  since you are a bit far from him when absorbing, just walk to your left
  or right (do not stop), the laser beams will not be able to touch you!!!
  If you are close to him, use the same strategy, only, you may need to
  circle behind him to get more space.
 -If the satellites are releasing beams, just avoid/block and place yourself
  close to Nobunaga for the next attack.
 -Whatever you do, just place yourself close to Nobunaga for the next attack,
  and destroy the satellite again by 4 hits, absorb.
 -Repeat the process.
 -If after absorbing, Nobunaga gets angry, he may want to slice you through.
  Just avoid or block.
 -When you are in the Oni form, which means you going to hurt Nobunaga for real
  and for sure, also every hit to the satellites will give you a health
  replenish souls (yellow soul).
 -Avoid his attack and combo him, for example: 3hits with [] combine with
  triangle button.
 -If he releases subsequent laser beams, avoid to the left and/or right
  in a timely manner.
 -you may get [Herb] when destroying the satellites :).

*Second Form:
 Goal: Beat him down and absorb the souls from the big sword to achieve
       Oni form (enable you to defeat Nobunaga).
 -Since the satellites have been destroyed, you need only to combo Nobunaga.
  Use 3 hit [] and then triangle.
 -He is able to perform 3 types of magic attack;
  1st-Cyclone attack:
  Three cyclones is searching for Samanosuke with a big gap of empty spaces.
  *Avoid by running away looking for an empty space until the cyclone is gone
  *If you are far enough then move in a circle from left to right or vise versa
  *Stand on the right side of Nobunaga then move in a clockwise manner
   circling him.

  2nd-Fire attack:
  Start from the front of Nobunaga then circling him in a counter-clockwise
  manner.
  *Stand still on the left side of Nobunaga then quickly combo him as the
   fire keep moving away from you.
  *If you are far from him, then quickly avoid to the left or right once
   the big sword touches the ground.

  3rd-Thunder attack:
  Start from the front of Nobunaga then half-circling him in a clockwise
  manner.
  *Circling Nobunaga from left to right/clockwise will leave the thunder
   trails behind Samanosuke.
  *Or just walking or stand outside of the Thunder trails circling Nobunaga.
  *If you are far from him, just look at the thunder tails above you and
   avoid standing near or below the trails.
  *Usually (but not 100% always), stand behind him is adequate enough :)~
   (When the trails are circling Nobunaga then you need to bail out)

 -Keep slashing Nobunaga.

*Third Form:
 Goal: To defeat Nobunaga for the last time :)~
 -He is MAD for sure. His hair turns into fire. All his words are made of fire.
 -Stay in a good distance when he is going to throw his words of fire.
  Move from left to right on a good distance (the edge) to avoid it.
  Approach him but hold your sword, go to his behind while avoiding his punch,
  then combo him.
 -Repeat the process.
 -Once a while he will perform charge attack.
  Listen to his mourn then avoid from a good distance.
  Combo him from behind.
  Actually this is his biggest mistake to do a charge attack so easily to
  avoid and leave his behind so widely open :)~.

This is it, the Ending and the True Ending of a True Masterpiece.
Normal Ending:
*Samanosuke is enjoying the beautiful day when Ako persuade him to continue
 on the journey.
 On the other part of the 'Earth', troops of samurai are marching to
 a new direction of purpose, mislead by the Evil General -Toyotomi Hideyoshi,
 used to be Kinoshita Tokichiro-
 (thanks to Sky Lee for the naming of Tokichiro, lee_cw@tm.net.my).
 The new name of Tokichiro is Toyotomi HIdeyoshi.
 (thanks to David Tran, kilvoctudbt@yahoo.com).


True Ending:

  dude, nice faq..but i gotta few tips i wanna share with my fellow
  otakus...first of all, if you guys have a save file of onimusha blade
  warriors, DO NOT DELETE THEM!!when you load the game for the first time you
  will get a trailer of shadows of rome(an excellent game) and samanosuke's
  panda costume, even if you never played onimusha3 before.then, many people
say that nobunaga is so hard, i beg to differ.

1.A BUG Report from Frankie Boyd, frankie_boyd@hotmail.com
  *Edited by the author*
  Most of us do not agree with Frankie Boyd :)

===============================================================================
  REPLY FROM JEI POTTER -ryune@cubiclecommando.com-
This actually isn't a bug. The enemies are meant to do that. You'll notice
that
these ninjas that do this are different from the normal ones(they have a
scarf)
  They're performing a ninja technique known as Bunshin. So... No, not a bug.

  Your friend,
  Jei.

  Glitch -And about the glitch that you mentioned before, I found it too
  in the US ver. of this game.
  First time I saw the enemy scramble, I thought its one of the ninja ability.
  Maybe you could pass this problem to Capcom. Thanks for your reading & nbsp;

  Why is Robert Tan still confirming about the GLITCH?
  Is this really a glitch? Come on guys, make a FINAL decision!!!

2.cirio@rome.com
  Hello I am Cirio. Could I make some correction about your FAQ.
  In Episode 8 where you have to put the password same as Anry said are wrong.
  It's RANDOM. Random for every new game. But If you die there and load again
  it remains the same.
  The kid maybe sound Anry but I guess Capcom tried to use a french football
  star's name Thiery Henry. Correct me if I am wrong.
  Good job with Onimusha3 faq, Cirio

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thanks Cirio. That is a very useful information.

Hey, thanks for the excellent walkthrough. It was very thorough. I just
noticed
  that when I was playing the game on "hard" mode, the puzzle that Jaque solve.
  ( the 1 where he has to repeat the password Anry is trying to input) This was
  different than when your playing in "easy" or "normal" mode. This is the
  password:
  1. Down, Circle, Left
  2. Down, Circle, Left, Right, Down
  3. Down, Circle, Left, Right, Down, Triangle, X
  4. Down, Circle, Left, Right, Down, Triangle, X, Up
  5. Down, Circle, Left, Right, Down, Triangle, X, Up, Down, Triangle, Right,
     Triangle
  It took me a bit to get it figured out but this is it.
I havent noticed anything else "yet", but if I do i'll be sure to let you
know.
  Thanks alot for the walkthrough,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thanks for saving us a lot of time :)

  hi bWoNg, you wrote:
  "You will be in a place where the 'ship' harbors. Remember Jacques?
  But no sign of him. Ako cannot warp to Jacques either.
  On the right top deck, you will find a [Small MP Recovery].
  At the top-right corner of the deck, if you use arrow, it will point out
  to a certain direction, but this time you got nothing."
  towards the end of your FAQ, i did the same action and got a RUNE STONE.

  When you do beat it, could you please tell me in detail the true ending,
  I don't like that fairy!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The first ending I got is when the Evil General leading an army of Samurai,
  marching forward to a new destiny of chaos.
  No fairy included, so no worry.
  Anyway, I will describe it better when I have time to beat that *** Nobunaga
  one more time.

6.neokillerx@yahoo.com
  You haven't listed the charge modified combos, the ones that end in a charge
  move. I suggest you do list them as they can be helpful to newbies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  That is a good idea, only I may not have the time right now to do the list.
  Anybody out there willing to lend me a hand?

  Hi, I've just read your walkthrough of Onimusha3, great job, that really
  helps a lot! Yet, I am currently stuck in the church (Notre Dame) where I
  need to absorb the dark aura from the statues. Your walkthrough said that
  'Now you need to visit the four of them one by one, starting from the statue
  with only one candles stand burning and so on.You have to absorb the negative
  auras from those statues in orderly fashion.' -- BUT HOW??? I just couldn't
  use the scroll! It would be very kind of you if you couldexplain that part
  a bit better, thanks a lot!

  Can u help me with my problem, i'm stuck here very long
  " Pick up the [Blue Power Capsule]. All the machines stop working.
  Go back to the save point and switch to Samanosuke.
  Do not forget to teleport the Blue Power Capsule.
  Route your way to the generator room and equip the Blue Power Capsule
  to power it up. Get inside the elevator outside and go to lower level.
  Smash those boxes to get one *Rune Stone*.
  Take the new weapon [Battle Axe].
  No, you cannot take out the Power Capsule anymore."

  to go back to the generator room the blue door cant access and i cant use
  the gliding like Jacques to go there by the ship.

*******************************************************************************
Allright guys, I received a lot of emails regarding this SPS15+G and those
who did not get this baby at the exact place as stated on this walkthrough.
The reason is because they are playing a different version, namely the
English version. That is why they get the new weapon on a different place.
I received some emails informing that you can get the SPS15+G after saving
Henry at the end of episode 7. So do not worry, you will get your weapon
as promised :)~

   Hi B wong, First of all, thank you for your anwser! Of course, I would never
   touch a ladies   stuff without her permission. No, my probleme is, that even
   when I use Michelle, in the box are just  Granades. But it's alright.
   I have got it later in the zoo at the end, where Michelle
   frees Samanosuke and Henri.

   It helped me out a lot. In Michelle Aubert’s walkthrough (Episode 7) I got
   Michelle’s SPS15+G in the Research Center while rescuing Samanosuke and Henri
   (Henry pronounced with a French accent). Maybe, it’s because I skipped the
Sewers Area because when I loaded an earlier saved game and backtracked for
it
   the box gave me grenades instead. I can’t be sure but that means,
   for anyone who missed the Grenade Launcher in the Sewers Area they can get it
   in the Research Center.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Thanks for your confirmation :)

   As for the false “Rune Stones” or Ecospirits in the American version, I read
   in a strategy guidebook somewhere that the disappearing ecospirits are not
a glitch. Since they are energies or forces from nature,some are not
contained
   enough and so go back to nature thus disappearing from your inventory.
   I don’t know what purpose it serves but I guess CAPCOM designed it that way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Anybody knows why Capcom designed it that way ?>_<?

In the Oni Mansion [The Trap House] where you are looking for the Oni Army
Orb,
   in the room where you obtain the [Book], there is a blue door to your right
when facing the red firefly and door. This can be activated by the blue
firefly
   in northernmost room with the Medicine [Tonic] and one of those pesky
   demonically possessed dolls. Activate it and go back, activating the red one
   along the way. There’s a Big Club here that you have to take care of first
   then slash through the calligraphy paper and follow the narrow corridor.
   Inside are a Medicine and a Soul Statue. However, it seems that after
   defeating this Big Club, two or three Big Clubs would be appearing once in
   a while in different areas of the mansion if you go back and forth too much.
   Also, it would be great if you could describe the firefly walkthrough in
   color sequence. Newbies like me would appreciate it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This is the English version of Onimusha 3.
   I will use this to clarify some confuses on the naming/items, etc
   and also to make corrections.
   Let me see what can I do once I get to the Trap House again :)
   All right, I have added a map and step by step arrangement :)

I got a add in on the guide you have on onimusha3 the best way to work on
your
chain moves is withthe pigs( or what i call pigs )the little spike things
that
   roll. well this is how ya do it, its almost the same as the way ya do it in
   onimusha2. You charge ya wepon to max level perferable 3 and way to the
pig rolls,right before he get to ya press square,and keep pressiong it,if
done
   correctly the character, either one of the two, will clear the whole screen.
   I can do this most of the time if the pigs are on the screen.
   THerefore this is a great way to work on ya chain moves. i think

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Give me your comment on this, guys :)

   I have an easier way to do issen, but I won’t take responsible of the effect
   that caused by doing this trick ^-^. All you have to do is tap the L1 button
   rapidly, if the enemy attacked you, this trick will increase the player’s
   chances to do the Hajiki Issen (block and counter), I seldom used this trick
   to defeat the big a** monster (you know why ^-^). Ow, have I mentioned the
   effect of this trick? I guess you already know….

   Hi.  I discovered something pretty useful in the game...  When using Michelle
   (especially during the zoo), change weapon to Assault  Rifle and change to
Yellow Vest for Ako.  Watch the incredible amount of red  souls u can get
from
   the enemy... esp birds and the plant thing blocking the  door to save the kid
   and the lead character...  Tip discovered by : Sheep & Richie  Hope it proves
   useful to others!

   Hey there. I have a quick question for you. In mission 6 at the Underwater
Temple there is a big yellow vase thing with a ring of light surrounding it
in
   the yellow door with the elevator. I've beat the game already and I never
   understood what was in the vase. Do you know how I can get whatever is in
   the vase? Reply if you can. Thanks a lot.

   I forgot what item. Let me check it out :)

Hi there ... i like your walkthrough but I have something I want to talk
about
it .  First : There is another bug in the game in Episode 11: The Eiffel
Tower
   before fight Genma Mori Ranmaru when you find that strange character I try
   to hit her i fall down from top to black screen .
   This happen when Ako wear black vest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   OH boy, another bug :)

   Actually, they're both wrong.  I believe this is actually Hideyoshi Hashiba,
   whom is mentioned in two of the documents you find in the port town.
   He's was  Nobunaga's second in command, and is apparetnly returning from
   quelling a  rebellion to the west.  It's also mentioned that Oichi,
   Nobunaga's sister, was seen  with him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Anybody need a prove ???

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


II. Side Mission: Help civilians to escape their faith.
    This is a side mission where you need to help some of the civilians
    -surrounded by evil soldiers- escaping their bad karma.
    In return, they will give you a present starting from a simple Herb to
    a more promising one such as Small MP recovery.

This Side Mission starts from Episode -- to Episode --.
1. Episode 8:

*Side Mission 1:
Once you completed the puzzle on the Garden and head to the next platform
with a locked gate with a handle and one Gear missing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In front of the locked gate, there is a man need your help. Do not let him die.
After saving his life, talk to him and he will give you a [Herb].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Side Mission 2:
Once you have saved all the slave civilians,
Heihachi will give you a key. After the cut scene, go help two people outside.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside, at the staircase hallway, there are two people screaming for help.
Do not let them die. Magic is the most effective in this situation.
Use magic one time for each rescue.
Talk to the first man and he will give you a [Herb].
Talk to the second man and he will give you one [Small MP Refill].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Side Mission 3:
Once completed Side Mission 2, go back to the save point where the locked gate
is located.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you arrived at the save point area, there is another man who is
calling for your help. Do not let him die.
After saving his life, he will give you [Small MP Recovery]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


III. Counterattack Moment.

1.Ninja:
  -At the end of each attack, from a good distance, press [].
  -During his (3 times) attack, from a good distance and press [] when
   he has just finished each/ the final attack.

2.Four Hands:
  -After his 2 Hit attack, from your good distance press [].
  -During his charge attack, when almost hit you with his blades, press [].
  -

3. Big Club:
   -Move around him especially behind him. When he is attacking from the top,
    press R1 to avoid and quickly press [] to counterattack.

4. Chain Ball:
   -Move to his side, block and counterattack or press R1 to avoid and
    counterattack.
