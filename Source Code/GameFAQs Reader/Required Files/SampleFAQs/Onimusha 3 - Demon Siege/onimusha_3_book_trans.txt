Welcome to the Onimusha 3 document translation FAQ!  Written as a companion FAQ
to my Onimusha 3 script translation FAQ, this FAQ presents the content of all
those books and other documents you find throughout the game (with the
exception of the "Oni Training Books" for the training stages).

Each document's name is followed by text in [brackets] detailing approximately
where in the game the document can be found.  The text following it in
(parentheses) is a translation of the explanation of the document as given
when the document is selected in the inventory screen.  Any relevant notes or
explanations are put in (parentheses) within the text.

In case the purpose of this FAQ is unclear, this is NOT a walkthrough or item
FAQ.  Furthermore, there are numerous spoilers here, so if you missed the big
* WARNING * at the top of this document and you still don't want to have
any developments revealed, then you'd best stop reading now.

<3.4.4>
TIME/SPACE RESEARCH BOOK (PART I)
[Found in the room with the lightning seal in Sakai.]
(A research book in which time warping is described.  The first book.)

Investigations regarding the Oni ruins have been going on for a long time, and
finally the first stage is complete.
After deciphering a vast set of records left in the ruins, it seems that the
secret of the Oni has something to do with time.  The device itself has been
discovered, but the method of controlling it is unclear to us Genma.  I,
Guildenstern, will pour everything I have into this and solve the mystery.
However, a little more time shall be necessary before a report can be given to
the Genma King.

But even if I do, the Genma assigned to the foreign ship--how incompetent they
are!  They're always attacking the townspeople indiscriminately.  I don't mind
if the humans are terrified, but there'll be problems if we run out of
workers.  They should really give us better, smarter people...

                                                      GUILDENSTERN
*******************************************************************************
<3.6.2>
TIME/SPACE RESEARCH BOOK (PART II)
[In the Underwater Temple in the past, in the second room past the yellow door.]
(A research book in which time warping is described.  The second book.)

My research on "Time Warping" is still full of problems.

Somehow we were able to start the Oni device that we found within the Oni
ruins, but
its functionality is always unstable.  Even if by good fortune a
"time warp" is generated, it disappears in an instant.

After countless failures, I realized something.

Recently, I have found extremely strange things here and there.  They are not
things made by the humans, and also not things that we Genma have made.  Could
these strange items be things from the "future" brought back using the "time
warp" that I created in my experiments?

If this is the case, then beyond the "time warp" undoubtedly lies a new world.

I shall pour the essence of Genma science into the Oni device.  The next
experiment will undoubtedly be a success.

We Genma shall control time itself.

<3.5.3>
TIME/SPACE RESEARCH BOOK (PART III)
[In Notre Dame, in the room beyond the underground save point.]
(A research book in which time warping is described.  The third book.)

MEMORANDUM

How can I say this...
When I was examining the device, suddenly I was launched somewhere.  It seems
that I had somehow crossed through time.  What I did was a bit careless.

On the surface, ignorant worms are roaming around.  Really annoying fellows,
no matter what time period they are in.  I shall quickly need to make a new
stronghold and find a way to return to the Oni ruins.

I found a good place at once.  It is a building that the humans call the
"Notre Dame Cathedral."  In the underground crypts nearby, there are tons
of human bones.  I shall command the Genma who crossed time with me and
build an underground castle.  It shall be my own castle, where I can freely
immerse myself in my research.

But even so, there are many things that I do not understand about the "time
warp."  I wish I could find something out...

<3.9.2>
TIME/SPACE RESEARCH BOOK (PART IV)
[At Mont Saint Michel (future), in the room with the warp to L'Arc de Triomphe.]
(A research book in which time warping is described.  The fourth book.)

I traveled through time due to an unthinkable accident, but it was a fortunate
thing that the Oni ruins at the bottom of the sea still remain even in this
time period. It hasn't changed that much since the time when I did my research,
and apart from the room with the device being underwater, most of my tools and
writings are intact.

I have decided to take them out and create a new "Time Warp" research facility
at "Mont Saint Michel."

The biggest problems with the "time warp" are stability and accuracy.  It's
meaningless if I can't send the thing that I want to the time that I want.  The
Oni clan was unable to do this, too.

It shall not be easy, but nothing is impossible for my brain.

                                                      GUILDENSTERN
*******************************************************************************
<3.9.5>
TIME/SPACE RESEARCH BOOK (PART V)
[In Mont Saint Michel (future), before the poison room.]
(A research book in which time warping is described.  The fifth book.)
Somehow, in order to generate a time warp, it is essential to have an enormous
amount of stabilized energy.

Thus, in order to collect limitless energy from the sky, I have installed the
device on the roof.  Our Genma science can create something from nothing.

Further, if there is an extreme change in the energy supply, it has a large
influence on my research results.  I shall order them to keep a constant watch
to ensure that at least 80% of the output is always retained.

Still, caution is necessary regarding Akechi Samanosuke's movements.  This
energy collection device is the lifeline of my research.  I must order them
again to be sharp when patrolling the surroundings.

                                                     GUILDENSTERN
*******************************************************************************
<3.12.1>
TIME/SPACE RESEARCH BOOK (PART VI)
[At the Eiffel Tower, before the elevator with the armored enemy.]
(A research book in which time warping is described.  The sixth book.)

As a result of continuing the research of the dead Guildenstern and reexamining
its contents, I have found out that in order to use the "time warp" device,
two "pulses" must be taken into account.

The first is the "pulse of time and space."
The flow of time has a pulse, and if the machine is started while it is
unsynchronized with that pulse, the "time warp" becomes unstable.  It is
believed that dissonance with this "pulse of time and space" is the
reason why Akechi Samanosuke was brought to this world when Guildenstern used
the machine before.

The second is the "pulse of the earth."
The place where the device will be operated must be established on the pulse
where the earth's essence is concentrated.

If it is incorrectly placed, it will cause the "time warp's" stability to
be ruined.

Taking the two pulses of "time and space" and "earth" into account, this
"Eiffel Tower," an iron tower in the middle of the city, is a suitable place
to set up the "time warp" device.

And then, when the two pulses are synchronized, if I add the energy that the
people in this age call "nuclear energy," I will be able to create a perfect
"time warp."  I must say that it is truly fortunate that in this time, in
this place, that such a perfect energy source exists.

Soon, I shall be able to bring large numbers of Genma to this world, starting
with Lord Nobunaga.

BANQUET "BOOK"
[Top floor of L'Arc de Triomphe.]
(Orders for the Genma to attack Paris.)

ATTENTION, LOYAL MEMBERS OF THE GENMA CLAN.

WE HAVE DECIDED TO MEET THE GENMA KING HERE IN THIS LAND.

REGARDING THIS, YOU ARE TO DISPOSE OF THOSE TROUBLESOME HUMANS AND ARRANGE
THEIR CORPSES FOR THE GENMA KING'S WELCOME PARTY.

YOU MAY CUT THEM WITH SHARP BLADES.
YOU MAY BITE THEM WITH POLISHED TEETH.

HOW YOU DO IT WILL BE LEFT UP TO YOU.

HOWEVER, YOU ARE TO WAIT UNTIL THE HOUR OF THE TIGER (3-5 AM) ON THE EIGHTH DAY
OF THE FIFTH MONTH, EARTH TIME.  AT THAT TIME, THE PARTY WILL BEGIN.
*******************************************************************************
<3.2.4>
THE BOOK OF DOUKAN (DAOKUAN)
[Found on the cliffs of Mt. Hiei.]
(An account of Mt. Hiei, which was set on fire.)

The second year of Genki (1571), ninth month.

At dawn, from every direction of Mt. Hachioji, Oda soldiers appeared.
Suddenly, fire broke loose, and it was like the flames of hell.

Numerous men and women, priests and laymen, were decapitated.
Their bodies were thrown off cliffs, and their heads tossed into the flames
as if they were firewood.

Although I was able to escape danger by fleeing deep into the mountains, when I
looked around, it was truly the image of hell.

Even now, the air is still full of the stench of charred human flesh, and the
people who were alive a while ago have become black lumps and haunt me.
Even if I crawl into the cellar and plug my ears, the groans of the dead will
not go away.
Caring only about myself and trembling in the shadow of a boulder--this is
truly a crime.

Although I can collect the skulls, bury them in the earth and chant prayers for
them, I cannot believe that I have been absolved of my crime.
Though it may take many years, I will carve a giant stone Buddha, and that
shall be my memorial service to my comrades.

THE STRATEGIC ORDERS "BOOK"
[Found at the top of the gate on Mt. Hiei.]
(Orders commanding the Genma to assemble on Mt. Hiei.)

The time has finally come for our master, Lord Oda Nobunaga, to ascend to the
throne.

First, the capital city of Kyoto will be taken by authority of the
exalted seal of "Tenka Fubu" (the slogan of Oda Nobunaga, meaning "all under
heaven covered by military force").

All those standing with our lord should assemble at Mt. Ei (Mt. Hiei) and await
orders from the capital.

MANAGER'S MEMO
[Found in the first room of the sewers.]
(A letter by a sewer worker addressed to his superior, regarding broken
equipment.)

Manager Cloquet-

It's been a while now that the winch for the cleaning ball has been broken, but
just when are we going to get money from the budget for it?  If we don't fix
it, the
garbage is going to pile up more and more.

If the sewers overflow it'll be our responsibility.  You understand that much,
don't you?

Hurry up and negotiate with the higher-ups, and get some budget money for
repairs.  If they tell you that it's OK to cut the chain and drop the cleaning
ball, that's a different story.

One more thing.  Don't forget that your neck is on the line regarding this
matter.  This isn't a threat.

RUMORS OF JUBEI
[Found inside Toraya, the shop in Sakai in Senshu.]
(A document in which rumors about Yagyu Jubei are written.)

The first year of Tensho (1573).  After doing violence to Nobunaga, Yagyu Jubei
disappeared.  Although Hashiba Hideyoshi sent ninja spies after his head, they
returned today, his whereabouts still unknown.

According to rumors, he was seen riding a horse in the mountains near the
village of Odani, and on a ship headed to the Southern foreign lands, but the
reliability of these are uncertain.
There are some who have speciously claimed that he was together with Lady
Oichi, but this is complete nonsense.  However, due to illness, Lady Oichi has
been seen by virtually no one these past few years, and this has caused rumors
about her to persist.
*******************************************************************************
<3.4.3>
RUMORS OF HIDEYOSHI
[Found in the room with the lightning seal in Sakai.]
(A document in which rumors of Hashiba Hideyoshi are written.)

Lord Nobunaga's right-hand man, Kinoshita Tokichiro, is now Hashiba
Hideyoshi.  Even after his family name was changed to Hashiba he serves
Lord Nobunaga well and is trusted by him.

When Lord Nobunaga was away, he managed the soldiers well, and in doing so
played a big role in increasing their power, increasing Nobunaga's confidence
in him.

After Lord Nobunaga returned, Hideyoshi was ordered to suppress the western
territories, so he led an expedition of several tens of thousands of men, and
even now he is continuing to fight there.
*******************************************************************************
<3.4.2>
INSTRUCTIONS FROM TORAYA
[Found in the area beyond the drawbridge.]
(Instructions from the owner of Toraya to his employees.)

Everyone -
I have a message from the House of Oda.
You are to take certain designated items from the shipment headed for Azuchi
Castle in Omi to Mt. Ei (Hiei).

Remember that you are not to be nosy.
It is essential that you keep your mouth tightly shut like a clam, and not
look at or ask about things unnecessarily.
Keep this in mind if you value your life.

SHIP'S JOURNAL
[Found in the "green room" on the boat.]
(A ship's log written by the captain of the Genma ship.)

I like this boat.

The pleasure boats on the lake beneath the earth are dark, smelly, and dirty.
But this boat is different.

The destination is a port belonging to the humans.  So even the boat's outer
appearance is the same as those of the humans' boats.

The creaking of this boat is the same as the scraping of human bones.
Screech, screech, screech...

Then, when I arrive at the port, there'll be a lot of food.  As many humans
as I can eat.

It's a great job, being a boat captain.
*******************************************************************************
<3.4.5>
NOTICE TO GENMA
[Found on the boat.]
(A notice to the Genma informing them of the appearance of a new person with
Oni Power.)

The other day, another person wielding Oni Power has been confirmed on Hiei.
The wielder of Oni Power is a Southern Barbarian man who wears strange clothes.
He wields a whip-like weapon and uses strange techniques.
Consider yourselves warned.

RUMORS OF THE GENMA WORLD
[In Notre Dame, in the first room with spinning blades.]
(A book on the fatal battle between Samanosuke and Garganto.)
Akechi Samanosuke Hidemitsu, wielder of Oni Power.
He appeared at Inabayama Castle, and with that sword he slashed Fortinbras, the
Genma King at that time.

After that, he doggedly pursued the new Genma King, Oda Nobunaga, and us, his
Genma retainers.  Thousands of Genma perished.
I have heard that Garganto alone fought many heated battles, but even
he, the strongest warrior of the Genma world, fell to the deadly blade of
Akechi Samanosuke.

And now he has landed here, where he once again swings his demon-like blade
against us.  Is there no one that can stop Akechi Samanosuke Hidemitsu...
*******************************************************************************
<3.5.2>
THE BOOK OF ABSORBING DARKNESS
[In the room with the sky-sealed door, before the pit.]
(A document about how to absorb the darkness covering the goddesses.)

The four goddesses art sullied by a wicked spirit, the holy light that they
hold shut away by black darkness.

Wield the power of the talisman, trust in the guidance of the small flames that
illuminate the goddesses, and seal away the black darkness in thy gauntlet.

If thou art successful, the holy light shalt shine once more, and a great power
shalt be thine.
*******************************************************************************
<3.6.3>
THE BOOK OF ONIGEMBU
[In the "library" of the Underwater Temple (past), upper level.]
(A stone tablet about a "flying machine" which the Oni have researched.)
We of the Oni clan are developing a new power, a "Heaven-Crossing Mechanism."

It has great power, and if used properly, it can transport even the holy
mountain of Fuji to the farthest reaches of the skies.

We have built a battleship using this power, and have named it "Onigembu."
The main body of "Onigembu" is on Onigashima Island.

Even if the Genma should raid the island in search for this, there is no
need to worry.

The secret of the "Heaven-Crossing Mechanism" is in this Underwater Temple.
As long as the temple is safely preserved, there is no need to fear the Genma.
*******************************************************************************
<3.6.4>
THE BOOK OF THE TEMPLE
[Found in the room with the red plate in the Underwater Temple (future).]
(A stone tablet about the Oni clan's shrine built at the bottom of the sea.)

The Genma offensive has become extremely violent, so we of the Genma clan have
built an underwater temple.
At the bottom of the sea, where even light cannot reach it, it has not yet
been invaded.
With this, the security of our clan shall probably be undisturbed for all time.

However, a man by the name of Urashima Something-or-other suddenly appeared.
It has been said that this man saved one of our clan's kin.

We held a welcoming banquet, and after three days we secretly led him to the
"warp."
Urashima Something-or-other, where have you gone now...

Our shrine shall not be known to anyone, no matter who they are.

(NOTE: This is a reference to a popular Japanese folk story called "Urashima
Taro."  A fisherman named Urashima Taro saved a turtle's life, and in gratitude
the turtle took Taro to his home, the Dragon Palace, under the sea.  Taro
stayed there for three days, or so he thought--he had actually been there for
hundreds of years, so upon his return to land, everything he had known was
gone.)

PARIS REPORT
[In Notre Dame, by Michele in the "library."]
(A report about a new experimentation facility.)
Here is my report.

After searching for a long time, I have found a new experimentation facility.

This new location is a facility which the humans call "Boulogne Zoo," and as
there are many kinds of animals which can be used as subjects gathered here, I
believe that it shall be to your taste.

Also, if you could use the usual spell on the humans, we can begin conversion
at any time.

I await your orders.

THE BOOK OF DEMON CREATION (First Half)
[At the Boulogne Zoo, on the top floor of the round building with four cages.]
(A research document about Guildenstern's live experiments.  First half.)
A zoo...
Could this be an experimentation facility of the humans?  Is this not a place
provided for the collection of and even experimentation on animals all over
the world?

Those damned impudent worms...
Haughtily gathering animals that are even lesser than they...

That's it!  Rejoice, encaged beings!  I shall make you my sons!  That way,
you shall not be devastated by cheeky humans!

This is a splendid idea.  I shall put it into action right away...

THE BOOK OF DEMON CREATION (Second Half)
[In the research room of the Boulogne Zoo, right before the save point outside
the room with Guildenstern.]
(A research document about Guildenstern's live experiments.  Second half.)

First of all, I infused Genma blood into a subject known as the "lion," the
King of Beasts.

However, it will be useless to me, as it just sleeps all day and all night.
Somehow it seems that this "lion" is that kind of animal.

What's more, its heart was weak, and it collapsed and died in three days.
Perhaps it was unable to adapt to Genma blood.
I had been trying to make a brutal Genma surpassing even Gertrude, but...

Next, I captured many kinds of monkeys, and I transplanted the gigantic hearts
of "elephants," enormous creatures with long noses.  As I expected, various
anthropoid apes were born, and so I shall introduce Genma blood into them.

Here, something interesting happened.
Somehow, the gigantic "elephant" hearts that were introduced have adapted to
Genma blood.  These humanlike apes are now able to possess even greater
strength.
It isn't my greatest masterpiece, but for now it is something with which I
can be satisfied.  I shall call this new son "Zumo."

RANMARU'S MEMOIRS
[At Mont Saint Michel (future), near the first save point.]
(Memoirs that Ranmaru has written.  His grudge against Samanosuke is spelled out
here.)

I have received news that Guildenstern has died at the hands of Akechi
Samanosuke.
There is no sadness.  All I have is anger at Akechi Samanosuke for interfering
in all of my lord's plans.

At the Oni ruins, I suffered an embarrassing defeat because my conversion was
not complete, but now there is no longer any need to worry about that.
I now have complete control over Genma blood.
Now, I possess the strongest of powers.

When next I meet him, I shall take his head and present it to my lord as a
gift, and I will cut his body into inch-long slices and feed it to the Genma.
I look forward to this time.

MEMOIRS OF A FRENCHMAN
[At Mont Saint Michel (future), in the room with the gear.]
(Memoirs written by a surviving prisoner.)

Someone, anyone!  Help!

I have no idea how much time has passed.
Days?  Or weeks?  I have not seen the light of the sun for days now.

The skeleton wearing the black cloak...that monster is the cause of this evil.

Because of that strange light that thing showered on us, everyone has become
suddenly quiet, as if hypnotized...

For some reason, though, I was unaffected.
Thanks to that I am reduced to running around trying to escape the monsters.
Perhaps it would've been better to be under that hypnosis.

Soon they're going to know that I was hiding here, and I'll be found.
No...surely they'll capture me and use me as food...?
I don't want that!  I'll escape...I'll make a clean getaway.

Aggh!  But before that, I'll probably die of hunger...

BEGADONNA'S DIARY
[At Mont Saint Michel (past), in the room past the gate with the

diary.  Her love for Nobunaga is spelled out here.)

Ah!  I am yearning for you, Nobunaga-sama...

It has been months since you entrusted this land to me.
I have been patient until the completion of that thing, but for you not to be
at my side, Nobunaga-sama, I never dreamed it would be so painful!

This feeling that tightens my chest.  The flames that burn in my heart.  This
is not anything like passion, it is love...unmistakably true love.

It is hot!  Hurry, quickly...before my heart is burned by the flames of
purgatory.  Please take me into those strong arms of yours.

Aaah!  Where are you now, Nobunaga-sama...

...It can't be!  With other whores...that's impossible!!

Aaaah!  I wish to go to you quickly, Nobunaga-sama.
I cannot bear this for an instant longer.
I shall work these humans to death, so that I can hasten the completion of
that thing.

Nobunaga-sama!  Please wait for me to return to you...

[In the Oni Trick House, near a point where you can absorb souls.]
(A book about the "Oni Army Pearl," which controls Oni soldiers.)

The Oni Armies are a group of soldiers that are controlled using the power of
the Oni.

The "Oni Army Pearl," which controls the Oni Armies, is hidden somewhere in
this land, awaiting the arrival of the chosen one.

In peacetime, they are hidden within the pearl, but they will appear when the
presence of Oni Power is detected.

Once they are released, they shall crush all enemies in their path.
They will be like a tidal wave.

[Inside the Oni Trick house, near a box containing an Onibotaru.]
(A book about the house built by the Oni clan on Lake Biwa.)

We of the Oni clan, in order to deceive the Genma, have built a house on this
land.
When looked at from the outside, it appears to be the work of man, but inside,
this is not the case.
Inside the house devices are set, and beyond them a power is hidden.

Wielder of Oni Power.
The time is like water spilling between your fingers.
Follow the guidance of the Onibotaru, and do not hesitate for even a moment.

FORTRESS BOOK (FIRST HALF)
[At Mont Saint Michel, after Jacques escapes from the poison room.]
(A scientific record by Genma scientists.  It describes a flying device.)

When we first started construction on an aerial fortress, we believed that our
Genma scientific techniques would be able to manage where power was concerned,
but we were wrong.
We were unable to maintain the necessary speed.

Through repeated trial and error, we arrived at a conclusion.
If we do not have the technology, we should take it from somewhere.  In order
for Genma science to progress, occasionally imitation is necessary.

Ten years ago, we witnessed Oni power.  If we could use that, we would be able
to give our aerial fortress speed.  We searched Onigashima Island.

Unfortunately, however, we were unable to find any data regarding a flying
device.  However, from a document left there, we discovered something else.
There are Oni ruins at the bottom of the sea.

We dove to the bottom of the sea, and took all of the technology regarding
flight that was there.  Using an underwater train, we also carried out
materials that we believed would be usable.
As a result, the flying machine performs according to expectations.
With this, we Genma have gained the power to control even the skies.  The day
is near when we shall reign as rulers of this world, both in name and in
reality.

FORTESS BOOK (SECOND HALF)
[At Azuchi Castle, near the save point.]
(A book about a large Genma that supports Azuchi Castle.)

"Hyuunbeid"

A large Genma that supports Azuchi Castle.  The form a "Baasaa," which has
strong and flexible wings, takes upon reaching the age of ten thousand years.
The number of living ones is extremely small.

However, its flying ability is abnormal, and it has sometimes been able to
lift even mountains.

It is calm, not suited for battle, and is used as a method of transporting
Genma that don't fly, and also to transport supplies and such.

In peacetime, it rests its wings in a large cavern beneath the earth and
sleeps, but when it awakens and begins to feed, it will eat thousands of
humans in a few days.

When its life is about to end, it releases millions of eggs.
But among them, only one or two become "Baasaas" which grow up to be
"Hyuunbeids."

RETAINER'S MEMOIRS
[At Azuchi castle, on the roof.]
(Memoirs about the reincarnated Nobunaga.)

Lord Oda Nobunaga, King of the Genma.

Though once felled by the accursed blade of the Oni clan, with Genma blood in
his body he breathes anew.

His divine power can split the earth and slash the skies.
Even when he dispatches tens of thousands of soldiers and horses with a single
slash, his limits cannot be known.

There is no need to fear the Oni clan.  Their skulls shall surely roll beneath
his gaze.

RANMARU'S MEMO
[At Honnoji, after Ranmaru is killed.]
(A memo from Ranmaru.  The exchange between Nobunaga and Guildenstern is
described here.)

The other day, there was a message from Guildenstern.
It's unbelievable, but that monster says he's in the "future."
My lord looks as if he probably has some interest, but what exactly is the
"future"?

The pulse of time runs through that day and that place?
That Guildenstern...what he says is completely incomprehensible.

Incredibly, he told him to go to Honnoji in Kyoto, even specifying a date and
time...
How impertinent of him, as a retainer, to summon his master.

At any rate, I shall obey my lord, and am prepared to defend him against
anything.

BLACKSMITH'S MEMOIRS
[Given to Heihachi at the blacksmith's.]
(A document left behind by the blacksmith.)

The other day, when the things called Genma attacked, the iron ore that I
ordered was stolen.  Without that iron, we cannot hope to repair the
drawbridge.

When the owner of Toraya, who ordered the repair job, heard that, he entrusted
a certain thing to me.
This item is called "Thousand-mile Oni Powder," and I heard that it was taken
from the monsters' cargo.  When "Thousand-mile Oni Powder" is burned in a fire,
a strange pathway of light appears.

Even though the pathway of light leads to the monsters' fortress, I cannot take
back the iron ore with my strength.  Of course, the pathway of light will be
closed after a certain time passes.

I do not know anyone courageous enough to go to the monsters' fortress, so
even now I cannot finish the repair of the drawbridge.
