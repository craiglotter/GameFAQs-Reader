                              01. C H A R A C T E R S

===============================================================================

a. Samonosuke
The samurai who defeated Nobunaga Oda in the first Onimusha game.  He gets sent
to modern day France.

b. Jaku
A French policeman who gets sent to feudal Japan.

c. Ako
A cute little fairy with black wings that follows the heroes around.  She's
similar to Navi from OoT except Ako actually helps you.

d. Misheru
I'm guessing in the US version her name will be Michelle.  She is a police
woman who uses guns.  She is the third playable character.

e. Andi
Jaku's kid.  He somehow has a sixth sense or something and can tell what's
going on in the demon world.  Maybe he is a demon in disguise?

f. Nobunaga
It took him two Onimusha games to come to his senses but he finally realizes
the potential of time travel.

===============================================================================

                              02. B A S I C S

===============================================================================

a. Fighting and Absorbing
Square button is used to fight.  Samanosuke can use a bow by pressing R1 and
then circle.  After you kill things you should absorb their souls.  The hard
part about fighting in Onimusha is that you have to absorb the souls in a short
amount of time after killing something but you have to protect yourself so that
the other demons in there can't hurt you while you're absorbing.  If there are
other demons in there, run away and absorb from a distance or when you get
better you can turn the fight to your advantage and make the enemies unable to
attack for a moment and then absorb.  You learn with practice.  There are such
things as instant kills.  If you attack just before an enemy attacks you a
flash of light will go off and you will kill the enemy with one hit and they
always leave yellow souls.  There are also quick kills.  When you knock an
enemy to the ground, step over them and press square.  Samanosuke will stab
them down and kill them and Jaku will step on them, take out his gun, and
shoot them three times to kill them.  Now for weapons.
Samanosuke - His three weapons are double swords, a long sword, and an axe.
             He can fire arrows by pressing R1 and then O.  The axe is so
             slow it is a hinderance.  Use the double swords during the
             beginning of the game and the long sword towards the end.
Jaku - His three weapons are a chain sword, spear, and a chain ball.  The
       spear is the best and should be used at all times.

b. Souls
Each enemy you kill gives off souls.  These souls have different purposes and
come in different forms.
* red - These are the most common.  They give EXP that you can use to upgrade
        weapons and armor.
* yellow - These refill your life bar but are somewhat rare.
* blue - These refill your magic bar and are also rare.
* purple - If you get five of these, you can enter demon form which makes you
           temporarily invincible and elevates the damage of your attacks.
           They are very rare and are also quite dense making them slow to
           absorb.  You should always try to get these if you can.  Unlike
           1 and 2, Capcom fixed the system so that you don't have to waste
           the souls if you get five of them.  You can save them and use them
           when you want to by pressing R3.  Also, if you die and have five
           of them, you won't die and you will enter demon form.

e. Upgrading
The red souls you get give you EXP which you can use to upgrade weapons and
armor.  Some doors require weapons to be a certain level so you can't really
run through without killing things.  You upgrade at save points.  Select the
second option to upgrade.

f. controls
Left Analog - Moves character

===============================================================================

*FRANCE*

Jaku is on his motorcycle talking to his son.  Then demons show up and start
killing everybody.  Jaku drives off to help.

*JAPAN*

A human army is getting ready to attack the demons.  Samanosuke shows up and is
given some new armor.

OUTSIDE CASTLE
You gain control at this point.  You have all your weapons maxed out so you
can probably guess that you're about to lose all that soon.  This means you
should take full advantage of this.  Also, don't be afraid to use your
magic because a magic replenish source is real near.  Join in the battle and
help your comrades kill the demons.  Kill the two bowsmen with your bow (hold
R1 and hit circle).  Once at the exterior of the castle, kill the two big
chain demons with your magic and then replenish it on the right.  There are
two HERBS around here in chests.  One is to the left of the stairs, the other
is under them.  The save point is on the right.  The first option saves.  The
second is for powering up.  The third takes you to hack fests and the fourth
is the exit.

CASTLE
Here Samanosuke meets Nobunaga and Annoying Man.  After the scene you have to
fight Annoying Man.

BOSS FIGHT: ANNOYING MAN
difficulty - easy
Get into battle stance by pressing R1.  Wait for him to attack (he always
yells in kendo style before he attacks) and then back away while still in
battle stance to rush backwards.  Then attack him when he's vulnerable.  Use
your magic during these instances.  He'll die after about three to four
minutes if you fight him in this safe manner.

*FRANCE*

Samanosuke is teleported here in some alley.

ALLEY
This is very Resident Evil 2ish, isn't it?  Destory the crate and get the
MEDICINE.

NOTE: If you beat the game already and earned that SWORD from the original
then it will be sitting in the middle of the alley.

Proceed forward and onto the streets.

STREETS
Jaku and Samanosuke meet here and then Jaku teleports to Japan.

Kill the demons and make your way to the subway.

SUBWAY
There is a crate that can be smashed which leads you to the next area.  Go down
the hallway and then up the stairs.

OUTSIDE ARCH DE TRIUMPH
Use the bow on the flying demons.  There are two chests around here.  They
contain a MEDICINE (on on the left of the arch), BOWS (close one), and a book.
Go up to the torches and a path is revealed.  Go down to get the DOUBLE swords
(his best weapon) and the one you should use the rest of the game.  The other
two are more powerful but are much slower and leave you vulnerable much too
often if you are not very good with them.  Go back up.

You meet some blonde woman.  She gets beat around and then Samanosuke comes to
help.

ARCH TOWER
Kill the two demons.

OUTSIDE ARCH
You're back outside.  Go back inside.

ARCH TOWER
Kill the demons and get the KEY on the floor.  Go up the stairs and use the key
on the door.

ARCH SHOW ROOM
There's a book on the counter.  There is a puzzle box in the top right (Again,
for puzzles, there is a good puzzle guide on GameFAQs).  Get the MEDICINE in
the chest on the left near the door.  Before exiting, go to the glowing pink
miniature tower and absorb all the souls out of it.  Oh, and the glowing item
near the entrance behind the ropes is not accesible at this time.

ARCH ROOF
You meet Gilderstern here and then fight a big robot.

BOSS FIGHT: BIG ROBOT
difficulty - easy
Use all your magic on him and then it's best to slash and run (especially when
he does his missile attack which follow you).  His best attack is a spinning
one where he comes towards you with great speed, twirling around.  If you don't
run behind him immediately after he starts this, you're going to get hit.  You
can't outrun this.  Stay close to him and slash away.  When he starts firing
missiles, run around him.  When he starts twirling, run behind him.  When he
extends his arms to do the stretch attack, run behind him.

*JAPAN*

Jaku finds himself in past Japan.

FOREST PATH
Save if you want and then run forward.

You will see Jaku's kid and then be given the soul absorbing gauntlet and a
weapon.

Kill the demon by staying at a distance and using the weapon's far reaching
ability.  Jaku's weapons are sort of cheap becuase they all can reach
distances that the enemies can't reach so you can stay back and avoid lots
of damage.  Jaku is also good at combos.  Hold R1 long enough for it to
charge and then attack with square.  Jaku will grab the enemy and then you
can either attack again, kick, hit circle, etc. Mix it up, really.  If you
grab them, you can also throw them by pressing in the opposite direction
and pressing square.

You'll meet a fairy here with black wings.  She follows you around and helps
you.  Remember that item in the arch showroom that was behind the ropes that
you couldn't reach?  When Samanosuke is back there, you can get this now
since the fairy can reach items like this for you.  When it starts talking
near an item, hit circle.

Kill the easy demons and proceed forward.  Ignore the plants since you can't
kill them yet.

FOREST SHRINE
You'll meet Samanosuke here.  Kill the demons.  You can throw rocks by holding
R1 and pressing circle.

After they shake hands, look around for chests.  Right near the path where you
start, there are breakable boxes which are hiding a GEM and a chest with a
HERB.  The fairy will pick up the gem for you.  Hit circle when it talks to you
to get it from her.  There is a SCROLL and a chest with a GARMENT to the right.
Go behind the shrine to the right and the fairy can get a HERB for you.  Go up
the stairs and kill the demons.  Proceed.

WEAPON AREA
Jaku can get a weapon here but he needs something first.  Go to the right.

WATERFALL AREA
Open the chest for a BUG.  These bugs help you swing around.  Hold R1 and
hit circle when it's glowing to swing.  Destroy the crate for another BUG
and keep swinging to the waterfall.  There are two SCROLLS near the buddha
statue.  Don't ask me what they say.  Go down the ladder.  Get the metal
circle in the chest.  Use the fairy to get the DRINK.  Destroy the crate for
a BUG and swing back.  Leave.

WEAPON AREA
Use the metal circle on the big thing in here and get your new weapon.  A
sword that stretches real far.  You can kill plants with this but ignore
the ones near you for now and head back to that first area you found them
in.

SHRINE
Proceed.

FOREST PATH
Kill the rolling demons and then the plants.  A chain demon falls so use
this instance to test your magic with this weapon and then finish him off
by staying at a distance.  Get the KEY that is there.  Now go back to the
weapon area.

SHRINE
Kill the enemies.  One enemy has a BUG.  Use it and get the MAGIC CHARM.

WEAPON AREA
Kill the plants and head through.

PLANT PATH
Kill all the plants along the way.

OUTSIDE STRUCTURE
Samanosuke will help you kill these.  Use the key and head in.

STRUCTURE PATH
Kill everything.  Power up your weapon and save.  Head through door.

STRUCTURE
Annoying Man is here.  They talk.  An enemy shows up.

BOSS FIGHT: GRINNING DEMON
difficulty - medium
For some reason I have trouble with this boss more than almost any other.  Stay
at a distance and swing on the bug a lot.  Keep swinging around and you'll
eventually hit him.  He will at one point send out many souls for no reason.
Do not try to absorb them because this is a trick to get you unguarded.  Once
you start absorbing, he will fly across the screen and hit you hard.  Wait for
him to end this attack and then try to absorb if you can.  The souls are not
worth the damage you will get.  Enter demon mode by pressing R3 if you have
enough purple souls.

*FRANCE*

Samanosuke talks with the blonde woman and then you control him.

OUTSIDE ARCH
Head back into the arch.

ARCH TOWER
Head up.

ARCH SHOWROOM
Get that hard to reach item now that you got the fairy.  They are FIRE BOWS.

ARCH ROOF
There are 2 chain demons and a very hard charging demon up here if you want
to fight them for some souls.  You can fight the two chain demons without
fighting the charging demon if you want to for some souls and items they have.

ARCH SHOWROOM
Two fast demons here.

ARCH TOWER
Descend and proceed.

OUTSIDE ARCH
Get back to subway.

SUBWAY
Enter the red door by using the KEY in the guard's hand.

SEWER 1
Kill the slug demons.  They leave small slugs that you can step on (similar
to spiders in RE).

SEWER POWER ROOM
Go to the red blinking thing and activate the power.  Save if you want.  I
was able to power the double sword to lv. 2 so maybe you can too.

SEWER 1
Activate the bridge and cross it.  Kill the slug.  There is a scroll in the
chest.  Kill the other slug and go through the door.

SEWER ROOM
There is a chest in the top right hall of here after you kill everything.  Go
open it.  I don't know what the hell that thing is but when you hit it, it
gives you yellow souls.  It looks like a little dutch girl or some kind of
gnome or something.  Anyway, when it runs away it leaves you a health item.
There is a connecting hallway to the right with a GARMENT and GEM.
Go over to the red door with the lock.  The combo is 3-1-4.  Before leaving
through the door to the left of this red door, head to the side of this room
where the hallway is.  Look up and hold R1.  The fairy will fly up to something
on the ceiling.  Shoot it with a arrow and you get a HERB.

SEWER 2
Head to the bottom of the screen once you get in the water.  The fairy can get
a HEALTH PACK here.  Head up the ladder on the right and get the WHEEL.  Head
back.

SEWER ROOM
Head up the ladder in here and use the wheel on that thing.  Head down the
ladder and activate that thing.  Head through the door right across from there.

SEWER 3
Activate the bridge.  Kill the slugs.  Once your double swords are on lv. 2 you
should start powering up your armor.  Save.  Head right and get LIGHTNING
ARROWS in the chest.  Head up the ladder and cut the chain that is holding a
big ball.  Go down the ladder and then into the water.  You have to push the
ball while fighting the demons at the same time.  Sometimes Mischeru goes
temorarily stupid and stops pushing the ball to stare at you fight demons.
Once Misheru stops pushing the ball and heads up the ladder, keep pushing it
for a HEALTH ITEM.  Go up the ladder.  There is a GEM to the right on the
ceiling.  Kill the demon and then head up the hall.  The guard gives you a KEY.
Ladder.

*JAPAN*

VILLAGE
Jaku is a village.  Run forward and go in some double doors.  Don't talk to
the man yet.  Go through the back door and get the GARMENT.  There is a SCROLL
in the store.  Slash the pots for a GEM.  Now talk to the man.  Something about
a watch is exchanged and Jaku is told to leave.  The guy locked the door so
you can't go back in for awhile.  There is a pot to the right of the save point
with a BUG in it.  Head up the ladder to the right and there is a chest.  Use
the bug to reach the beach where a puzzle is.  Talk to the kid looking in the
barrel.

Go to the alley close by and talk to the guy near the watermelons.  He
will give you one.  Give this to the kid and he'll leave.  Examinine the barrel
for a BUG.  Use it to get up and enter.  Get the KEY and then use the bug to
get down.  The fairy can get a MAGIC ITEM near the counter.  Exit.  Kill
everything and then go into the alley.  Progress through here and you'll see
a swinging demon.  This thing usually swings five times in a row and then stops
leaving a time for you to attack then wait for it to swing again.  Kill
everything and use the key on the door.

WEAPON ROOM
There is a DRINK the fairy can get near the entrance.  Get the new weapon.
It has the speed of the last one but more strength.  Exit.

VILLAGE
Kill everything and then save on the main path.  Head through the gate.

DOCK
Kill everything and get to the door with the blue circle.

STORAGE SHED
There's lots of modern things in here like washer machines and CDs.  Get the
book in here and then go into the back to get the SCROLL in the chest.  Leave
after the scene.

DOCK
A chain demon clears your path.  Kill him and then go up the new stairs.  You
meet a guy named Hiehachi here.

BOSS FIGHT: Heihachi
difficulty - very easy
Fight him like any other enemy.  His only attack that you may have to worry
about is when he starts spinning his weapon.  Stay away and slash from a
distance.  He should go down easily.

DECK
Kill everything and go through the door.

BOAT
Go down the stairs.  Destroy the painting.  Inside the chest is another one of
those gnome things but this one's a male.  I don't know if this was boss fight
or what but this thing fought me for like five minutes before vanishing.  He
gives you a KEY which you should use on the door in this room.  Oh, and he has
an axe that he hits you with.  It doesn't take off much though.

ENGINE ROOM?
Get the BOOK in here and exit.

The boat will go under water.

*FRANCE*

Hopefully your swords is on lv. 2 so go through but not before getting the GEM

through.

CIRCLE ROOM
There is a yellow door, blue door, and red door in here with corresponding
things sticking up in the center circle.  The only door that you can go through
is the yellow door because the yellow circle is in place.  You can go through
if you want but the place is flooded and Samanosuke can't proceed so go up and
get the YELLOW CIRCLE in the thing sticking up.  Now get the SCROLL in the
chest near the save point.  Near the save point is a teleporter which allows
Samanosuke and Jaku to teleport items to eachother and let you switch between
them.  Use the teleporter.  The first slot is the items you can transfer.
Select the YELLOW CIRCLE.  Now the option under the items is the player
switching.  With the yellow circle on the right side of the screen switch to
Jaku.

difficulty - easy
This is a very easy boss.  It charges back and forth basically and does a ice
attack which freezes you and also a lightning attack as well which it throws
at you and also a fire attack sometimes as well.  Maybe the yellow, blue, and
red areas are linked to these elements?  Stay on the other side of it.  Once
it starts charging, dash to the side and then attack.  Use up all your magic
on him and even switch to demon form if possible.  He'll die after about five
minutes.

You're now playing as Misheru.  Run up and demons will break the fence.  Don't
fight anything yet and run over and get the RING in the chest.  It gives you
the ability to absorb souls.  Now kill everything.  Go back down into the
sewer but save first if you want.  Oh, you start out with a SPS15+S which is a
shotgun essentially.  You are about to get a grenade launcher and will most
likely never touch this weak thing again.

SEWER 3
Make your way through the long hall.  Eventually you'll get to the ladder on
the left so climb it.  Kill all the slugs and then head right.  Go up the
ladder and get the SPS15+G which is the grenade launcher.  Switch to this and
then head back down the stairs and cross the bridge and go in the room.

SEWER ROOM

Go inside.

ND
Go down stairs.

BENEATH ND
Kill the two fast demons that jump down and then go through the door.

KNIFE ROOM 1
Go into the open doorway.

SKULL ROOM
Go down the hall and enter the door.

KNIFE ROOM 2
Go into the room with the save point next to it.

TELEPORT ROOM
Go forward and two spinning sword demons show up.  Point and shoot.  Then go
into the new room and get the BOOK.

Ako shows up and then Samanosuke and Andi are shown in a cell.  Misheru then
shows what a bad driver she is.

PARK ENTRANCE
Run forward and kill everything.  Those big ape things are no trouble with the
grenade launcher but wait until you have to fight them with Samanosuke.  There
is a PIECE OF PAPER on the floor next to the sign that says "BATEAU".  There is
something in the chest to the left of the stairs on the left.  Go up the
stairs.

PARK 1
Kill everything and go through the door at the end.

PARK OFFICE
Two of those monkey demons are in here.  Go through the door at the end.

PARK 2
Kill the rolling demons.  Get behind the panda to see Misheru and Ako in a
comical fashion.  Make your way around the circular structure and go in.

AQUARIUM
Go around clockwise and get the book by the door.  Then go down into the
aquarium.  There is a switch mechanism that lowers capsules with things in
them.  The first one lowers a monkey demon.  The second lowers a key.  The
third lowers another monkey demon.  The fourth one lowers a SPS15+R which is a
sniper rifle.  This is only useful later in the castle part so keep the grenade
launcher equipped.  Go up the ladder and go around counter-clockwise.  Use the
first door you come across to go back to park 1.

PARK 1
Go to the bottom and back to park entrance.

PARK ENTRANCE
Go to the right and into the Bateau area.  Go down the stairs and enter the
boat.  Use the key you just got on the boat.

Misheru and Ako talk for awhile here about what, I don't know.  It seems to
have some significance.  Then the engine stops and demons show up.

Kill the two demons (fast + water) and then absorb the souls.

Ako gets excited when the boat starts and then you're parked in a new area.

BOAT LANDING
Go up the stairs.

OUTSIDE BUILDING
Go inside.

BUILDING
Remember not to get items and leave them for Samanosuke.  Kill the plant and a
path is revealed so go down.

CELLS
Run forward and a scene will play where you see Samanosuke and Andi locked up.
The monkey demons burst through and you have to kill them.  Now go the red
flashing thing on the wall and unlock the cells.  Prepare to laugh.  This next
scene is one of the funniest things I've seen in a game.  You then control
Samanosuke again.  Playing as Misheru softened me up and I forgot how to
actually fight for awhile so make sure you don't forget that you can't shoot
things from across the screen anymore.  Go get the things in the chest that you
hopefully left for Samanosuke (someone that can actually use them).  Also get
that RING thing on the floor, no I don't know what it does but you probably
need it.  Go up the stairs.

BUILDING
Kill everything and then get the two GEMS hanging from the ceiling.  There is a
chest in here also.  Exit the building.

OUTSIDE BUILDING
Use Ako to get the item to the right of the stairs.  Start powering up your
long sword.  Go down into the boat.

BOAT LANDING
Get in and start it.  Demons come so kill them.

PARK ENTRANCE
Go up and kill the rolling demons.  Go to the very entrance and go up to the
Souvenirs store and get the MED PACK in the chest.

PARK 1
Kill the monkey demons and get the GEM in the trash can on the top next to the
door and then enter it but not before having Ako get the item to the right of
the stairs leading back to the park entrance.

PARK OFFICE
Kill the two glowing demons and then ignore the door with the two blue circles.
Go to the last door but not before breaking the glass in one of the squares and
having Ako get a MED PACK.

PARK 2
Get the MED PACK in the chest to the left of the door.  Go back to the office.

PARK OFFICE
GO to the other door and exit but if you already have the blue sword on lv. 2
then go in the door.

PARK 1
Head back to the entrance area.

PARK ENTRANCE
First kill all the rolling and flying demons and then power up your sword.  If
you still need red souls then leave and enter this area over and over again.

PARK 1
Go back to the office.

PARK OFFICE
Enter the door with the two blue circles and enter.

BATHROOM
Get the KEY and leave.

PARK OFFICE
Go back to the door you just came in here from.

PARK 1
Go across and leave.

PARK ENTRANCE
Go over to the boat and use it.

BOAT LANDING
Head up stairs.

OUTSIDE BUILDING
Go in.

BUILDING
Use the key on the door that looks like an elevator.

LAB 1
Make your way to the room in here.  Get the BOOK and the SCROLL and then go
over and save.  Enter the door.

LAB 2
I don't know what he's doing to them but it's probably bad seeing how Andi is
yelling "Yarete!  Yarete!!"

BOSS FIGHT: Gildernstern
difficulty - medium
Gildernstern floats around shooting things at you and creating glowing demons
that fight you.  At first there is only him.  Shoot him when he glows pink.  He
does this when he is about to do something.  Later he creates one glowing
demon.  Fight the demon but shoot Gilderstern whenever he glows pink.  You can
hit his projectile back at him if you are skilled at timing.  When two glowing
demons are fighting it gets more difficult.  Kill one of them but don't try to
kill the second because the first one will come back soon so when there is only
one just run around waiting for Gilderstern to turn pink and then shoot him
with the arrow.  At the end, he will try to go back to the past at the
beginning of the battle and you will have to fight this all over again so don't
get caught in the black circle on the ground he makes.  Towards the end (you'll
get a general idea of when the end is) start keeping a good distance from him
and just fire arrows when he glows pink.  Don't try to fight the glowing demons
when you think it's almost over.

Samanosuke, Misheru, and Andi all take the car now to an old castle.

NOTE: You are about 2/3 through the game now.

CASTLE ENTRANCE
There is a save point close by that you should use and also a teleporter but
wait to touch that.  Get the BOOK on the floor.  Kill everthing and then switch
to Jaku.

TRAIN SIDE
Jaku gets off the train and sees Heihachi.

He's the same as the first time and just as easy.  Stay away and slash at him
from a distance.  It's safe to not go for multiple hits because he will resist
them and attack you in the middle of a combo so hit him twice and then back
away and hit again.  The key is to keep a distance or he will hurt you.

Kill all the flying demons in here including the one holding the BUG.  Destroy
the crate to the left of the train for a GEM.  Use the bug and then go in the
door.

GARDEN
Get the BOOK in the chest and then proceed into the center of the garden.  Get
out the chain sword and light the four torches with it.  It's smart to light
one of the two closest ones to the moving thing in order to run in there
quickly after lighting them.  Get in and get the KEY and then light the torch
in there at the right time for it to stop itself and let you out.  Go to the
other side of this area and go in the door.

CASTLE ROOF
Use the bug and then get over to the roof.  Kill everything and then talk to
the guy here for a HERB.  Use the purple teleporter to send Samanosuke the key
and then switch to him.

CASTLE ENTRANCE
Use the key on the gate to the top of the screen.

CASTLE ENTRANCE 2
Kill everything and then get the BOOK in the chest.  Go through the door.

CASTLE PATH
Kill the plant and get the GOLDEN CIRCLE in the chest behind it.  Go back.

CASTLE ENTRANCE 2
There are two chain demon shere to kill.  Exit.

CASTLE ENTRANCE
Use the golden circle on the gate to the left of the screen near the save
point and go in.  There is a chain demon to kill.  Get the RED THING in the
chest and then use the fairy to get something near the edge of the walkway.
Absorb souls out of the pink temple thing.  Go back to the teleporter and
send Jaku the red thing and switch to him.

CASTLE ROOF
Go into the door to the left.

CASTLE STAIRS
Use the red thing.  The tiles need to be stepped on in the right order.
You can only walk from left to right and up to down (no diaganol walking).
So the first time should be in this order.
Star -> Sun -> Moon
The only place you can start is the bottom left.  Make your way around in the
right order.  There isn't ever a time when you have to choose between two
stars or two moons or two suns so just keep moving.  The second time is in
this order.
Ah.  This time you have to make a decision at one point.  Oh, it's
Sun -> Moon -> Star
This last time you have to make a decision as well but just as long as you step
on the right symbol, the thing won't come down and hit you.  Even if it does
it doesn't do any damage except a little.
Moon -> Star -> Sun
Stairs are released so go down.  There is a door to the left which leads to an
area where the hanging man is.  He can take you to a hack fest if you want.  On
the stairs, kill some enemies and then destroy the crate on the bottom for some
bugs.  Run back and use the bug to swing up.  There is a demon here to kill.
Swing across and then kill the demon here.  Go down and kill the plant.  Then
open the gate.

CASTLE ENTRANCE 2
Kill everything and look for something to release a bug.  Fly up to get a
GARMENT and then go back down.  Exit this area.

CASTLE STAIRS
Go back up to the roof.

CASTLE ROOF
Switch characters.

CASTLE ENTRACE
Run across to the gate and go in.

CASTLE STAIRS
Run up to the gate on the left and go in.

TELEPORT ROOM
Kill the demons and then teleport in teh circle.

ALTERNATE PARIS (What is this?   Silent Hill?)
Go up into the arch after killing the plant.

ARCH TOWER
There are slugs in here.  Go up.

ARCH ROOF
There are some hard enemies here.  Kill them and get the KEY in the chest.  A
teleportation cirlce appears so go in.

TELEPORT ROOM
Leave.

STAIRS
Go down to the bottom and to the entrance.

CASTLE ENTRANCE
Send the key to Jacque and switch.

CASTLE ROOF
Go into the door.

CASTLE STAIRS
Run down to the gate on the bottom and go in.  Use the key on the locked door
here.

GEAR ROOM
Kill the two demons and get to the top left to get the DRINK in the chest.
Exit.

STAIRS
Heihachi gives you a KEY here.  Kill the demons and then talk to the guy here
for a HERB.  Go up the stairs and to the roof.

CASTLE ROOF
Use the bug on the edge to get to a door after saving the guy and talking to
him.

GARDEN
Make your way to the door.  You'll have to fight some glowing demons.

TRAIN AREA
Float down and the key on the door here.

CELL ROOM
Run forward and Jaku saves them.  Get the ROOT on the floor and exit.

TRAIN AREA
Put the root in the square closest to the tree here.  Use the bug to go up and
through the door.

GARDEN
Make your way around.

CASTLE ROOF
Switch to Samansouke.

CASTLE ROOF
CLimb down the tree.

TRAIN AREA
There is a GEM in the trashcan around here and also a MED PACK behind the gate
on the left that Ako can get.  Also a anothe GEM in another trashcan.  Go in
the door.

CELL ROOM
Smash the boxes and get the GEAR.  Also, there are two GEMS in here in boxes.

TRAIN AREA
Climb the plant.

CASTLE ROOF
Send the gear to Jaku and switch to him.

Use the gear on the left and then pull the thing.  Go in the new door.

CHURCH
Kill the plant to get access to the chest which has a HEALTH and then get the
book on the floor and then go through the door.  Go down and...

OUTSIDE CASTLE
Andi uses his sixth sense to sense his "pa pa" is in trouble.  You're playing
as Misheru again.  As I'm typing this she's running her hand through her hair.
What kind of sane person worries about their hair when demons are running
around?  Run forward and to the left to get that mysterious RING again.  Go
through the door.

CASTLE ENTRANCE
Kill things (the sniper rifle works good here) and then go to the door where
the glowing demon is shooting things at you from.

STAIRS
Run up and go to the door at the top.  I kept hitting the button for awhile
and it kept showing symbols and I was like, "Well, I guess there's some key
or something", so I went around looking for it and then after no success
came back and it let me in.  So, keep skipping past the symbols and it'll
let you in.

CASTLE ROOF
You're now Samansouke.  Get the RING on the ground or just leave the stupid
thing there and get in the door you start by.

CHURCH
Kill the spinning sword demon and then go in the door.  Save here.  Go down.
Andi hits these buttons and you have to copy him.  It progresses, like it
starts with up down triangle and then ads more.  I couldn't get the cut off
points but you don't need them.  Just keep doing this below.

up, down, /\, X, O, down, up, [], left, X, X, right

CASTLE ENTRANCE
Defeat the demons and save.  Exit this area.

OUTSIDE CASTLE
Hmm... I wonder if a huge demon is going to burst out of that suspicious
rock...

BOSS FIGHT: Two Headed Demon (Second Encounter)
difficulty - easy
It's the same boss except it has about four times as much health.  This is
probably the longest battle in the game.  Just keep dodging it's charges
by going left or right and then attacking and then running to the other side.
The hardest part about this thing is when it knocks you down.  It's so cheap
that it will continue knocking you down over and over and there is nothing you
can do until it either stops or you manage to dodge it which is very hard at
such a close range.

They escape in the car.  Silly gaijin are overly emotional as usual, right
Samaosuke?

CASTLE POISON ROOM
Jaku now.  Go into the door here.

CASTLE BACK ROOM
Kill everything and there is a BOOK to get.  Use the bug and destroy the crate
for a GEM.  Go into the door.

What was he trying to do?  Well, he gets attached to the flying thing with the
cannon.  What is that, the Junon cannon?

SNOW AREA
Who the **** is this Heihachi guy?  One minute he's giving you keys, the next
minute he's trying to kill you.  Now he's sitting by fires with you.  Heihachi
then wanders off, probably to attack other friends of his.

Save and the destroy the crate for a BUG.  This area is pretty big.  You keep
getting on icebergs and using the bugs to pull over.  At one point you come
up on an area where you can choose between two paths to two different icebergs
but they both end up in the same area in the end.  Always look for crates to
smash which have bugs in them.

At the end, you'll be in front of a house and Samanosuke will away from you a
bit.  You should save and then go in.  You'll be locked in.  For some reason
I got the idea that Samanouske was behind this... Why was he hanging back there
waiting for you to go in?

HOUSE MAZE
There are lots of respawning swinging demons here but Jaku is so powerful now
you don't even really have to fight them (just grab them by holding R1 until
it powers up two colors and then grab them and press in the opposite direction
and press [] to throw them.  Then run over and do the quick kill).  First run
all the way to the last room by using the red bug to open the door.  There is
a blue bug in here.  There are two blue doors it opens.  Ignore the blue door
close to this bug and run all the way back as far as you can.  Activate the red
bug and then go in the first room you came in.  Quickly run in the blue door in
here.
In the chest is a BUG.  Kill the swinging demon here and then get the HEALTH in
the chest in the back and use the soul absorbing thing.  You have to destroy
the purple paper to get back here.  Activate the blue bug and leave.
Activate the red bug and go into the next room.  There is a GEM to the left in
here.  This area was unaccessible before you got that bug in the other room.
Swing across and activate the yellow bug.  Now swing back across and run all
the way up.  In the last room is a blue bug to use.  Go in the room next to it
and run to the left into the yellow door.  Save and jump down.

UNDER MAZE
Kill the two charging demons and then use the bug that comes out to get up.
SAVE HERE.  Before you proceed make sure you have an hour or so to spare.

BATTLE GROUND
This part is just awesome.  You really should not leave until you are on level
20 with your red souls.  This is basically free souls, red, blue, and yellow.
There are so many enemies and they are all the easy ones that have very long
attack stances that you can actually get chain instant kills.  I've gotten up
to a five chain instant kill.  Since instant kills always leave yellow souls
you are basically always replenished.  Your health should never go below
half way because of all the potential instant kills and yellow souls.
Make your way to the right while killing.

Okay, you should get to a gate so go in.

BATTLE AREA
THere's more of the battle in here.  Make your way over and use the bug.  Then
there should be another gate.

ANOTHER BATTLE AREA
Small little area with battle.  Use the bug to get up.  Use the bug on the
right to get a DRINK.  Go through the gate.

GOLDEN TEMPLE
You'll see Heihachi here and Annoying Man.  Save here.  Then go up the
elevator.

GOLDEN ROOM
THere are some demons to fight.  Get the SCROLL, I guess, in the chest and then
go through the window.

ABOVE GOLDEN TEMPLE
There is a puzzle to the right if you care.  Use the bug to go up.  The
Grinning demon from earlier jumps down.  He is just the same.  Stay at a
distance and use the weapons long reach to your advantage.  The fairy can get
a DRINK to the left.  Go in the window.

GOLDEN ROOM 2
Go to the left for that chest that was visible in room 1.  Then save and go up
the stairs.

BOSS FIGHT: Demon Woman
difficulty - very easy (if you know what you're doing)
             medium/hard (if you don't)
She is extremely fast and dodges any attack you throw at her unless she is
attacking also.  Wait for her to attack and then slash her twice (any more
and she'll dodge and hit you).  If she jumps up on the railings, run behind
her and she can't attack you.  If she jumps on the wall, run away so she can't
attack.  Just wait for her to do ground attacks and then counter.  That's the
easiest and most sure way of beating her.  If she doubles herself, she can do
great damage if you let them team up on you.

Go up the ladder.

After the scenes are done, you're Samanosuke at the Eiffel Tower.

TOWER ENTRACE
There is a puzzle box to the left.  Look around for a chest with a MED PACK.
Go into the door after saving.  You have to press the red switch to the left
of it.  Then press the red switch inside.  Kill the fast demons that burst in
and then press the red switch next to the ladder.  Go up the ladder.

ABOVE ELEVATOR
Kill and then go up ladder.

STAIRS
You have to make your way up the stairs while avoiding the teleportation
circles that randomly form on the levels between stairs.  The rolling demons
are what makes it difficult because they knock you back into them.  What you
should do is stay on the stairs, and kill the demons before running quickly
to the next stairs.  Try to stay at the top of the stairs because if you're on
the bottom they will knock you into teleportation circles.  At the top there is
a spinning sword demon and a circle which forms around him.  Try to lure him
away from that area, back towards the stairs you just came from.  Up stairs.

BALCONY
BOSS FIGHT: Big Robot
Same techinique.  He has more health though I think.

Once he's done, look for a machine that glows light blue.  It has a shutter
that closes every now and then.  Attack it when it's open and break it.  A
path is now open to the right of a chest in here.

MORE STAIRS
Same strategy as before.  You'll get to a point where you run on a blue wire.
At one point it goes left and right.  Go right and then to the stairs.  Go up
and do the same as before.  You'll get to the top and there is a charging
demon and one of those demons that throws those rings around you.  Kill them
and go up the stairs.

BALCONY 2
There is a LITTLE DUTCH GIRL in a chest to the right and HEALTH in the chest
to the left.  Go up the stairs.  To the bottom right are FIRE ARROWS that Ako
can get for you.  There is a BOOK to the right.  Hit the red switch next to
the elevator to activate it.  A spinning sword demon comes down.  I found a
quick way to kill them just now.  Hit him with a lightning arrow and it stuns
him.  Then run over and attack him and he'll fall down.  Then do a quick kill.
Go in the elevator.

BALCONY 3
Use the soul absorb thing in here and then save.

BOSS FIGHT: Annoying Man
He's the same as before.  You'd think at this point in the game button mashing
wouldn't be enough to win but it is with this boss.  Just go crazy on him when
souls start coming out and he tries to absorb them.  You can keep attacking
him and he'll keep trying to get the same souls.

*JAPAN*

Back at the beginning but with Jaku.  Make your way to the building.

Jaku beats up Annoying Man.  There is the weird hanging man who can
take you to hack fests by the save point.  Save and go inside.

BUILDING

BOSS FIGHT: Nobunaga
difficulty - medium
This battle is easier than you'd think.  Just use magic on him.  Go through
all your weapons and use it all.  Then start swinging and you'll hit him
eventually.  This is it for Jaku so use all your stuff.

*FRANCE*

Watch the scene where Samanosuke teleports.  Then another scene.

*JAPAN*

Payback time.  Save and then go inside.

This next part isn't really a fight.  YOu can't get hurt and you deal super
damage.  Hit triangle to kill him quickly.  It's like the fight with Sephiroth
at the end of FFVII.

*???*

BOSS FIGHT: Demon Nobunaga
difficulty - easy
You are in demon form.  Keep hitting triangle until he drops his sword.  At
that point, absorb the evil from his sword.  Now you are using his sword.  Keep
hitting triangle on him over and over.  He does some attacks you can't avoid
even if you run away.  So stay as close as possible and keep hitting triangle.
It's pretty easy if you have some health.

HIHACHI SUB GAME

Walkthrough:

DOCK
You start here.  Kill everything and head into town.  There is a new room here
that was not in the main game but there's nothing in there but you can check
it out if you want.

VILLAGE
Samanosuke is here to help.  Kill everything and then go onto the side path.
Continue to the back path.

BACK PATH
There are bowmen here and a swinging demon.  Kill them and head into the shrine
thing.

SHRINE
Talk to the guy in here and he'll give you a BOOK and a SQUARE THING.  I went
over to the fire in here and used it.  I thought it was some kind of weapon
material or something.  It opened a portal.  I don't know if you have to
use this at the fire or not.  Enter the portal.

TEMPLE AREA
Exit.  Make your way to the circle room.  Find the door that takes you to the
long undersea hallway.  Fight the two headed beast.

I Don't know if this is some kind of time attack or what but a timer started
a little after this and I died.

More on this later.

A: Beat the game and then save.  It will be in the alley in France where you
start as Samansouke.  It's glowing on the ground.

Q: What is that slip of paper that looks like a Japanese charm that was in my
inventory the whole game?  I got it under Notre Dame.
A: I don't know.  Someone asked this on the message board on GameFAQs and no
one answered them.  I want to know too!  Answer them!
