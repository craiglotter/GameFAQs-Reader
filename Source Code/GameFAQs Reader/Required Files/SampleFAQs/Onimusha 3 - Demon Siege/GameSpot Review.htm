												<p align="left">For all the hard 
												work the heroes of the Onimusha 
												series have had to do, slaying 
												countless demons and zombies in 
												their effort to vanquish the 
												power-hungry warlord Nobunaga, 
												they've been woefully unable to 
												finish the job. Nobunaga returns 
												once again as the main bad guy 
												waiting for you at the end of 
												Onimusha 3: Demon Siege. 
												However, this time the adventure 
												doesn't just take place in 
												medieval Japan, but also in 
												present-day France. The game 
												stars Samanosuke, the noble 
												samurai from the original 
												Onimusha, and it also introduces 
												a new main character, Jacques, a 
												French commando bearing the 
												distinctive likeness of actor 
												Jean Reno (<i>The Professional</i>,
												<i>Ronin</i>). In addition to 
												the unlikely cast and the 
												time-twisting premise, Onimusha 
												3 also features a control scheme 
												that's vastly improved over its 
												predecessors, and it ultimately 
												offers up a substantial 
												single-player action adventure 
												filled with impressive visuals, 
												lots of fast action, and a few 
												clever twists. Fans of the 
												Onimusha series will certainly 
												enjoy this episode, as would 
												just about anybody intrigued by 
												the premise of the game. </p>
												<p align="left">Onimusha 3 
												begins as Samanosuke, along with 
												a small army, is assaulting the 
												fortress in which Nobunaga has 
												been pinned down. It would be a 
												very short game if this were to 
												be the warlord's last stand, so 
												instead, a temporal rift 
												suddenly appears during the 
												confrontation, and Samanosuke is 
												whisked away to Paris in 
												2004--and he's not the only one. 
												The sorts of demonic 
												fiends--called genma--that have 
												plagued medieval Japan now 
												appear in droves in the streets 
												of France, and they begin 
												slaughtering everyone in sight. 
												One of the survivors of this 
												onslaught is Jacques, who 
												unwittingly becomes Samanosuke's 
												counterpart. Both men gain the 
												favor of the Oni, in the form of 
												a soul-sucking gauntlet and the 
												ability to wield elementally 
												imbued weapons. And even as 
												Samanosuke ends up in the 
												present, sure enough, Jacques 
												ends up in medieval Japan. Now, 
												with the help of a little winged 
												spirit named Ako (basically a 
												black-winged Tinkerbell), who 
												can conveniently whisk her way 
												across space and time, these two 
												warriors will need to put a stop 
												to Nobunaga's nefarious time-traveling 
												schemes--and hopefully find a 
												way back to their respective 
												eras. </p>
												<p align="left">The story starts 
												strong, and all the time-bending 
												business is a good setup for a 
												few of the puzzles later on in 
												which you'll be able to transfer 
												key items across the ages and 
												affect the future by 
												accomplishing tasks in the past. 
												In a few key sequences, 
												Samanosuke and Jacques will find 
												themselves in the same place, 
												but hundreds of years apart, yet 
												they'll still be able to assist 
												each other thanks to Ako. 
												Perhaps due to all the 
												space/time conundrums, sometimes 
												the plot loses its course. For 
												instance, Jacques frequently has 
												occasion to concern himself with 
												the strained relationship 
												between his young son (who gets 
												way too much screen time in the 
												game) and attractive fiancée, 
												even while he's fighting for his 
												life. Meanwhile, Ako's spunky 
												schoolgirl attitude is 
												presumably there for comic 
												relief, but she's just annoying, 
												despite being so darn useful. 
												You're probably not expecting 
												Onimusha 3 to be the greatest 
												story ever told; still, the 
												story could have been a bit less 
												ham-fisted, if it only kept to 
												the point. And in spite of the 
												unorthodox premise, the story 
												mostly just goes through the 
												motions you'd expect, especially 
												if you've played the previous 
												games in the series. </p>
												<p align="left">Apart from the 
												plot, there are two main 
												differences between this 
												Onimusha game and previous 
												Onimusha games. One is that, 
												this time, the graphics are all 
												3D, whereas previous games in 
												the series featured 3D 
												characters on top of prerendered 
												2D backgrounds. The 3D backdrops 
												here are a bit of a trade-off. 
												They do lend the game a more 
												cohesive look, but at the 
												relative expense of some of the 
												visual richness of the past 
												episodes. Make no mistake--this 
												is still a gorgeous-looking 
												PlayStation 2 game, featuring 
												great-looking character models, 
												lots of believable settings, and 
												some impressive visual effects. 
												Onimusha 3 plays fast and smooth 
												for the most part, though there 
												are times when the action 
												noticeably and significantly 
												slows down, which is 
												unfortunate. This usually 
												happens when there are more than 
												four or five enemies onscreen, 
												which isn't often. Also, while 
												the 3D backgrounds are 
												ultimately a step in the right 
												direction, it would have been 
												nice if they were more 
												interactive. Apart from the odd 
												button, breakable garbage can, 
												or treasure box, there's nothing 
												to do in these environments. 
												Your character won't even come 
												to a halt if you run into a 
												wall--he'll just keep running in 
												place, like a mime going against 
												the wind. Onimusha 3 does a much 
												better job handling the 
												interaction between your weapons 
												and your enemies. The animations 
												look great, and most 
												importantly, the controls are 
												tight and responsive. </div>

											<div class="content lh16 cl">
												<p align="left">The controls 
												haven't been this responsive in 
												the past. When Onimusha first 
												debuted as a hack-and-slash 
												samurai-themed Resident Evil 
												spin-off, one of the main 
												tie-ins between the games was 
												their shared control schemes. 
												The old, antiquated Resident 
												Evil-style controls are still 
												available in Onimusha 3 if you 
												use the directional pad as 
												opposed to the left analog stick 
												to maneuver your character. 
												However, there's no question 
												that the analog control is much, 
												much better. The game has a few 
												occasions in which transitions 
												between camera angles may cause 
												you to take a cheap hit from an 
												offscreen enemy, but for the 
												most part, you're afforded a 
												high degree of maneuverability, 
												and you can easily conduct 
												battle on your own terms. The 
												action itself follows Onimusha's 
												strong formula. It's simple and 
												streamlined, allowing you to 
												merely mash on the X or square 
												button to execute effective 
												attack combos, but there's also 
												incentive to play with finesse.
												</p>
												<p align="left">By properly 
												timing an attack just as your 
												opponent is about to strike, or 
												by immediately attacking after 
												deflecting an enemy's blow at 
												the last possible moment, you 
												can execute a deadly critical 
												hit that causes your fallen foe 
												to let loose a much greater 
												quantity of soul orbs than 
												usual. As in past Onimusha 
												games, souls are used as 
												currency for powering up your 
												weapons and defenses (as well as 
												for restoring your health and 
												magic), so there's constantly 
												good reason to be pulling off 
												these instant-kill moves. 
												Optional training sequences will 
												give you plenty of practice with 
												these and Onimusha 3's other 
												combat techniques, such as 
												Jacques' ability to entangle his 
												enemies with his energy whip, 
												shoot them a bunch of times with 
												his pistol, and then slam them 
												into the ground. The action here 
												isn't complicated or terribly 
												deep--you'll fight many of the 
												same types of enemies over and 
												over, and most of them aren't 
												particularly challenging. But 
												Onimusha 3's gameplay is fast 
												and good looking, rewards 
												careful timing, and offers up 
												enough variety between the 
												playable characters and their 
												various weapons so it's 
												consistently quite fun. </p>
												<p align="left">Besides dueling 
												against various demonic goons 
												and the occasional boss 
												opponent, Onimusha 3 presents 
												some light puzzle solving. Like 
												in previous games, some of the 
												treasure chests are puzzle 
												boxes, where you'll have a set 
												number of turns in which to 
												slide puzzle pieces around to 
												complete a circuit. These can be 
												pretty challenging. Most of the 
												other puzzles aren't very 
												difficult, though, and the 
												game's linear structure means 
												it's usually pretty obvious 
												where to go or what to do next. 
												There's a fair amount of 
												backtracking in Onimusha 3, 
												which is usually considered a 
												bad thing in today's games, but 
												in this case, it's disguised by 
												sequences in which Samanosuke 
												and Jacques will have to retread 
												the same ground at different 
												times--so it's more interesting 
												than tedious. Overall, Onimusha 
												3 offers a reasonably lengthy 
												single-player adventure that 
												will take you about 15 hours 
												from beginning to end; there's a 
												generous quantity of unlockable 
												bonuses to keep you busy after 
												that. </p>
												<p align="left">While there's 
												only the default difficulty 
												level available at first, if you 
												die a few times an optional easy 
												mode is unlocked. A hard mode 
												becomes available once you 
												finish the game, along with a 
												side quest involving one of the 
												game's ancillary characters. 
												There are some other extras, 
												too, such as unlockable extra 
												outfits and minigames. Onimusha 
												3 also lets you choose between 
												red, green, and no blood, and 
												adjust between low and high 
												levels of violence 
												(specifically, volume of blood 
												spilled). Annoyingly, the 
												toned-down settings are the 
												default, and you can only change 
												your settings when you begin a 
												new game--so if you only happen 
												to notice the green blood a 
												couple of hours into the 
												adventure, you'll need to start 
												over from the beginning to see 
												the game as it was originally 
												intended. At the same time, it's 
												nice that Onimusha 3 lets 
												players (or parents) adjust the 
												graphic nature of the content if 
												necessary. </p>
												<p align="left">One option you
												<i>don't</i> get in Onimusha 3 
												is to hear the original Japanese 
												voice-over. At the beginning 
												(and end) of the game, the 
												French characters can be heard 
												speaking their native language. 
												Thanks to Ako, though, 
												Samanosuke and Jacques will soon 
												be able to understand each other 
												as they magically switch over to 
												English. It must be said that 
												the voice acting in Onimusha 3 
												is markedly better than that of 
												the previous game. But that's a 
												relative compliment, since the 
												previous game's voice acting was 
												dreadful, and some of the 
												performances here definitely 
												sound forced. Sadly, Jean Reno 
												only provides the French 
												dialogue for Jacques, though the 
												voice actors for him and 
												Samanosuke put in some of the 
												better performances. </p>
												<p align="left">Like its 
												predecessors, Onimusha 3 has 
												plenty of dialogue and story 
												sequences in it, though by far 
												the most impressive cutscene is 
												for the game's cinematic 
												introduction, which is actually 
												some of the best, most lavishly 
												produced in-game CG to date. 
												Overall, the game's graphics are 
												generally well matched by its 
												audio, which consists of 
												appropriate anime-style 
												sword-slashing effects (which 
												may sound familiar from the 
												previous games). There is also a 
												musical score that appropriately 
												flits between European-style 
												orchestral and Japanese-style 
												instrumentations. </p>
												<p align="left">Onimusha 3 
												maintains the series' very high 
												standards for production 
												quality, and it features vastly 
												improved controls, an 
												entertaining premise, and Jean 
												Reno, who's good in pretty much 
												everything, including this game. 
												Those are a lot of good selling 
												points right there, and Onimusha 
												3 doesn't have any significant 
												shortcomings to compromise them, 
												either. So, if you're a fan of 
												the series or just want to play 
												an action adventure in which you 
												can hack up tons of ugly 
												monsters--with style--then this 
												game is just the ticket. </div>
