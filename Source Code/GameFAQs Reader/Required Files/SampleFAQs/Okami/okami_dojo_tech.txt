IViii. New Game +
===============================================================================

After you complete the game, you can start a new file with a New Game +.
You keep your stats, Yen, Praise, and most of your items. However, you don't
keep all of your Dojo Techniques. The ones you keep when you start a New Game +
are:

-Reflector Technique- 4 Winds
-Reflector Technique- 5 Winds
-Rosary Technique- Spirit Storm
-Rosary Technique- Spirit Armageddon
-Glaive Technique- 3 Shears
-Glaive Technique- 4 Shears
-God Technique- Wailing Mirror
-God Technique- Bead String
-God Technique- Sword Dance
-God Technique- Counter Dodge(You have to re-learn Fleetfoot to use this)
-God Technique- Holy Falcon(You have to re-learn Holy Eagle to use this)
-God Technique- Golden Fury
-God Technique- Brown Rage

Counter Dodge and Holy Falcon are most likely kept so that you don't have to
wait until you get to Kamui to learn them again.
