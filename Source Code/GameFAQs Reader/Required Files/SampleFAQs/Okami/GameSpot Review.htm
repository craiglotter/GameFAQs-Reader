												<p align="left">It's only 
												fitting that a game about a god 
												should have an awe-inspiring 
												presentation such as this. Okami 
												is based on the Japanese legend 
												of the sun god, Amaterasu, whom 
												you control throughout the game 
												in the form of a white wolf. A 
												truly epic journey awaits this 
												wolf, who wields divine power 
												quite literally as an artist 
												wields a brush. Despite its 
												unusual premise and other unique 
												qualities, Okami is in many ways 
												a textbook action adventure 
												game. It takes its cues from the 
												Legend of Zelda series in 
												particular and achieves 
												similarly outstanding results. 
												Much like in those games, in 
												Okami you'll traverse a vast 
												countryside filled with 
												intrigue, meet a variety of 
												interesting characters, delve 
												into dungeons chock-full of 
												various traps and 
												fearsome-looking creatures, and 
												become more and more powerful as 
												you go. All the while, Okami's 
												stunning good looks give it the 
												appearance of a cross between a 
												cartoon and a traditional 
												Japanese ink-and-watercolor 
												painting, and perhaps best of 
												all, the game keeps going and 
												going for much longer than most 
												other games like it. </p>
												<p align="left">Though Okami's 
												premise and characters are 
												steeped in Japanese folklore, 
												you don't need to be familiar 
												with the source material to 
												appreciate this game--you just 
												need a bit of an open mind. The 
												story plays out like a 
												modernized anime version of a 
												myth, except with a far more 
												original visual style than what 
												most anime brings to bear. The 
												story is simple: Amaterasu, 
												reborn as a white wolf, has a 
												mission to rid medieval Japan of 
												a demonic curse that's swept 
												across the nation. Apparently, 
												it's all the doing of a massive 
												eight-headed serpent that was 
												killed 100 years ago and has 
												been reborn. Will history repeat 
												itself, or is there an even more 
												sinister plot at work here? At 
												the beginning of the game, 
												Amaterasu is joined by a 
												pint-sized creature named Issun, 
												a bold and smart-alecky little 
												guy who does all the talking for 
												the both of them. Their journey 
												begins by purging the evil from 
												a small village but expands to 
												encompass all corners of Japan, 
												and beyond. The story unfolds 
												mostly through frequent, nicely 
												animated cutscenes. There's a 
												lot of dialogue throughout the 
												game, which makes for plenty of 
												reading since all the characters 
												speak in gibberish that sounds 
												just vaguely Japanese. </p>
												<p align="left">The story boils 
												down to a conventional battle of 
												good against evil but 
												effectively sets up a series of 
												remarkable, self-contained 
												subplots that are all seamlessly 
												interconnected. During your 
												quest to purify Japan, you won't 
												just battle that eight-headed 
												serpent--you'll unearth the 
												cause of a deadly plague 
												threatening a huge city, help 
												villagers in danger of freezing 
												to death from a relentless 
												blizzard, come face-to-face with 
												an enormous water dragon that's 
												terrorizing Japan's coastline, 
												and more. While the game is a 
												little dense with exposition, 
												overall you'll feel like you've 
												gone on an incredible and long 
												journey once all is said and 
												done. It helps that Okami will 
												take you at least 30 hours to 
												finish the first time through, 
												and that's not due to any 
												sources of frustration during 
												the gameplay, either. Okami is 
												very long for an action 
												adventure game, especially for 
												one that has so much beautiful 
												scenery in it. If anything, the 
												game probably could have shed a 
												couple of hours for a slightly 
												quicker, tighter pace, since the 
												experience can start to drag in 
												a few spots, such as an 
												obligatory 
												fight-all-the-bosses-again 
												sequence near the end. The 
												game's scarce shortcomings are 
												all this minor. </p>
												<p align="left">Just running 
												around in the world can be 
												exciting, which is fortunate, 
												because there's a lot of running 
												around to be done. Amaterasu, or 
												&quot;Ammy&quot; as her companion likes to 
												call her, can run very quickly 
												and jump quite high, and when 
												engaged in battle, she fights 
												with a divine instrument on her 
												back that acts like a sword. 
												Since she's a wolf, she can also 
												bark and dig holes, but that's 
												not all. The most unusual aspect 
												of Okami's gameplay is in the 
												brush techniques you'll 
												frequently have to use to defeat 
												foes and reach places no man or 
												wolf could go, and these 
												represent her divine powers. </p>
												<p align="left">You'll learn 
												more than a dozen different 
												brush techniques over the course 
												of the game, each gifted to Ammy 
												by one of her fellow animal 
												gods. These let her harness the 
												power of the elements, slash 
												clean through solid stone and 
												other objects, rejuvenate 
												plants, blow things up, and much 
												more. To start using brush 
												techniques, you just press and 
												hold R1 to make the scene 
												instantly switch to look like an 
												ink painting on parchment while 
												a large brush (that appears to 
												be Ammy's tail) comes down from 
												offscreen. Then you can draw 
												these simple shapes and lines, 
												corresponding to your different 
												brush techniques, and miracles 
												happen. For example, Ammy can 
												change night into day if you 
												paint a circle in the sky, or 
												she can cleave an enemy in two 
												if you paint a line straight 
												across that foe. She can create 
												large lily pads that serve as 
												floating platforms in the water, 
												and then summon gusts of wind 
												that will push this makeshift 
												boat along, among a variety of 
												other uses. It's exciting to 
												gain each new brush technique, 
												as well as to discover new ways 
												of putting together everything 
												you've learned. </div>

												<p align="left">You'll need a 
												bit of time to recharge your 
												divine energies if you use too 
												many brush techniques in rapid 
												succession, but overall, you'll 
												be using these moves regularly 
												and often both while exploring 
												and while in combat. The 
												brushwork takes a little getting 
												used to, but you'll have plenty 
												of time to practice. The whole 
												system winds up being novel and 
												fairly deep, since some powers 
												vary in effect depending on how 
												you draw them. The game also has 
												a number of puzzles and battles 
												that make clever use of the 
												different techniques you'll pick 
												up as you go. In addition to 
												learning brush strokes, Ammy 
												will grow more powerful in other 
												ways. For instance, she can 
												learn new fighting moves from an 
												eccentric martial arts master, 
												one of the game's 
												wildest-looking characters; you 
												can increase her maximum health 
												and celestial ink reserves; and 
												she'll find multiple new weapons 
												and many other items during the 
												course of the game. You get a 
												good, clear sense that your 
												character is growing stronger 
												and stronger as the story 
												progresses. </p>
												<p align="left">Though Amaterasu 
												has a daunting mission, the 
												journey in Okami is never 
												particularly difficult, mostly 
												due to the abundance of health 
												power-ups you'll find or that 
												you can purchase. If there's a 
												problem, it's that there's 
												virtually no limit to how many 
												of these items you can carry 
												with you. You also have access 
												to an &quot;astral pouch&quot; that can 
												bring you back to life right on 
												the spot should you run out of 
												health, so with all that aid, 
												it's possible and likely that 
												you'll get all the way through 
												Okami without ever seeing a 
												&quot;game over&quot; screen. This is 
												mostly to the game's credit, and 
												it's still got some fairly 
												challenging puzzles and jumping 
												sequences, in addition to some 
												other surprises in the form of a 
												couple of fun minigames. The 
												game's combat is also 
												entertaining even though most of 
												the fights, even against the 
												biggest and seemingly deadliest 
												foes, are quite easy. You'll 
												encounter all kinds of 
												imaginatively designed foes and 
												get to lay into them with 
												fierce-looking attacks, with 
												some help from that divine brush 
												of yours. The combat is 
												fast-paced and, like everything 
												else about Okami, it simply 
												looks terrific. </p>
												<p align="left">Despite the 
												sheer variety of demonic enemies 
												in the game, combat isn't too 
												frequent in Okami. As you 
												explore the wilderness, you'll 
												see packs of demons represented 
												by floating talismans, and 
												touching these will send you 
												straight into the fight. 
												However, it's easy to avoid most 
												such encounters if you want to. 
												While there's a lot of 
												four-legged traveling to be done 
												in Okami, since you run so 
												quickly and the scenery looks so 
												good, it's nothing if not 
												pleasant. You do find means of 
												fast transportation later on in 
												the game, making it easy to 
												cross from one side of Japan to 
												the other in a flash. Much of 
												the game also takes place in 
												various towns and villages, in 
												which you'll be speaking to 
												dozens of unique characters, 
												many of whom are quickly 
												endearing due to the game's good 
												dialogue and fantastic art style 
												and animation. You'll also spend 
												lots of quality time 
												rejuvenating the land, bringing 
												withered vegetation back to 
												life, feeding woodland 
												creatures, and so forth. This 
												aspect of play is far more 
												satisfying than it might sound 
												like, partly because it's 
												through these acts that 
												Amaterasu earns praise, which 
												functions as experience points 
												that you can spend on improving 
												your powers. Not that Amaterasu 
												wouldn't be doing all these good 
												deeds out of the goodness of her 
												heart. </p>
												<p align="left">You'll be 
												hard-pressed to find a 
												better-looking game for the 
												PlayStation 2. The game's look 
												is unlike anything out there, 
												with the possible exception of 
												2003's The Legend of Zelda: The 
												Wind Waker for the GameCube, 
												less because the art styles are 
												similar and more because the art 
												styles are each so distinctly 
												stylized and skillfully 
												presented. While Okami doesn't 
												include support for widescreen 
												progressive-scan displays, it 
												still looks positively 
												spectacular. The game's visual 
												style is cohesive, original, and 
												flawlessly executed. Every scene 
												shimmers with life, except for 
												the scenes that are covered in 
												the thick, evil fog that 
												disperses in a flourish of lush 
												vegetation when Amaterasu works 
												her magic. Great character 
												designs both for human 
												characters and for all the weird 
												demonic foes you'll encounter 
												further guarantee that you won't 
												soon forget the unmistakable 
												look of Okami. While the visuals 
												alone aren't what make this such 
												an impressive game, they enrich 
												every moment you'll spend in the 
												game's surreal world. </p>
												<p align="left">The audio is 
												similarly excellent, though you 
												might wish Okami's story was 
												delivered in full speech. The 
												sound effects are great, while a 
												superb musical score filled with 
												traditional Japanese 
												instrumentation and modern 
												melody accompanies most every 
												sequence of play. It perfectly 
												matches both the game's art 
												style and its tone. Speaking of 
												the tone, since Okami is 
												basically a fairy tale, it's 
												rather kid friendly...with the 
												possible exception of the tiny 
												Issun's occasional lascivious 
												comments when he's in the 
												presence of attractive young 
												ladies. The game's good-natured 
												attempts at humor lend it a 
												likable, distinctly Japanese 
												sense of weirdness. </p>
												<p align="left">Okami's long 
												quest is filled with high 
												adventure and gives you reason 
												to come back for more once 
												you've finally finished it. You 
												can restart the journey with 
												most of the weapons you've found 
												and abilities you've acquired 
												and try to seek out all the 
												world's remaining secrets and 
												side quests that you didn't find 
												the first time. So there's much 
												more to this game than you've 
												probably come to expect from the 
												typical action adventure 
												experience, and the game is so 
												well crafted from top to bottom 
												that it's bound to impress just 
												about anyone who gives it a 
												chance. Now that the PlayStation 
												2 is in the sunset of its years 
												as one of the most popular game 
												systems ever released, it's 
												somehow fitting that a game like 
												Okami should come around to help 
												ensure we'll carry a fond memory 
												of the system long after we've 
												moved on. </div>
