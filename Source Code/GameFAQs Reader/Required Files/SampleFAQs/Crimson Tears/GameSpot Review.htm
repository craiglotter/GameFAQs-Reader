																																		<p align="left">Crimson Tears isn't broken in any way, and if you can overlook the occasionally frustrating fixed camera, it gets better the more you play it. </div>
																																	<div class="content lh16 cl">
																																		<p align="left">Crimson Tears is an unusual game in which Spike has combined relatively mindless beat-'em-up action with role-playing elements that, although far from complex, are actually quite involving. The game does a great job of masquerading as a simplistic exercise in button mashing in the beginning, but as you progress through its increasingly large, randomly generated levels and you are pitted against a number of varied bosses, it reveals itself to be a quite challenging and occasionally unforgiving fighter. The difficulty curve is pretty steep, the gameplay can get incredibly repetitive, and the futuristic storyline amounts to little more than an instantly forgettable episodic cartoon that plays in between levels. However, the character building and development make enough meaningful changes over the course of the game that some players just might get hooked. </p>
																																		<p align="left">The main reason that Crimson Tears is more difficult to stop playing than it really should be is its RPG-style character advancement and weapon systems. Since all three of the game's playable characters are bioengineered humanoid weapons (known as mutanoids), they don't come with any baggage as far as convoluted backstories are concerned--Amber, Kadie, and Tokio are essentially <i>Terminator</i>-style killing machines, only without the Schwarzenegger catchphrases and sunglasses. At the start of the game, they're really not that proficient--their attack and defense attributes are weak, their combos are short, and the arsenal of weapons at their disposal is kind of disappointing. The more you play the game, though, the stronger they become. Every time you kill an enemy you get experience points that count toward your character leveling up, and certain items that you find let you upgrade your special moves and combos. </p>
																																		<p align="left">Despite that they specialize in the use of different weapons, the three playable characters in the game are actually very similar, especially since a lot of the weapons can be used equally effectively by any of them. When fighting, you'll spend most of your time banging out combos using the game's two melee attack buttons, but in addition to those, you have a ranged attack, a block, a powerful special attack, and an &quot;absolute field&quot; move that serves as a kind of short-range smart bomb, which causes significant damage to any enemies close to you. You can use special attacks and absolute field moves at any time, but since doing so causes your character's temperature to rise quite dramatically (more about that later), you'll only want to use them only when it's absolutely necessary. </p>
																																		<p align="left">Gaining access to new and more powerful weapons is actually one of the most entertaining aspects of the game, since obtaining them invariably requires you to upgrade an existing weapon using various components that you've looted from enemies. Occasionally you'll get lucky and loot a decent weapon from a fallen enemy, but for the most part you'll be visiting the weapon vendor in between levels to have him repair the weapons you've been using and to see if you have the necessary items for an upgrade. Strangely, your weapons gain experience in much the same way you do, and when you level up, the weapons' attacks become stronger and they need repairing a little less often. Many of the weapons in the game boast one of seven attributes that can make them more or less powerful against certain enemies, and these include thunder, heat, power, photon, cool, speed, and shade. Early on in the game you really don't need to worry too much about your weapons' attributes, but as you progress you'll encounter enemies and bosses that can be extremely challenging if you're using the wrong kind of weapon. In addition to attributes, some of the weapons you have access to can cause your enemies to suffer from the same abnormal status effects that are often used on you, such as paralysis, poisoning, and burning. Most of these pass after a time, but since the adverse effects can be quite significant, it's usually best to go into your inventory and see if you have a cure. </p>
																																		<p align="left">In addition to a health bar, all three of the playable characters have an MT gauge that measures their current temperature. Every time you perform an attack, your character's heat will increase, until eventually, he or she will overheat. At this point, the screen turns bright orange and your speed and attack strength are doubled; the flip side, though, is that your defense becomes much weaker and you lose health until you cool down. Coolant and cooling gel items offer a way for you to return to normal whenever you like, provided you're able to find some or have them stored in your inventory. The space in your inventory is pretty limited, so once it starts to fill up you find yourself constantly having to choose whether to keep abnormal status cures and health-restoring energy drinks, or whether you should make room for the weapon components that do you no good on the current level but that might serve you better in the long term. The one item you never want to be without is a &quot;returner,&quot; which lets you exit the current level at any time and take all of your items back to the garage that serves as your base. </div>

												<p align="left">If your 
												character runs out of energy 
												midlevel, you have the option to 
												send a second character in on a 
												rescue mission that has to reach 
												this energy-deficient character 
												within a time limit of a couple 
												of minutes or so. You don't 
												really have time to engage in 
												combat when on a rescue mission, 
												so it's really just a case of 
												following the directions that 
												you're given and doing your best 
												to avoid enemies and hazards 
												such as falling ceilings. If 
												you're killed during a boss 
												battle, the rescue system works 
												a little differently, giving you 
												an opportunity to send a second 
												character in for a rematch. If 
												you take up the offer of a 
												rematch, you'll find that the 
												boss is still damaged from the 
												first fight, but that your 
												second character isn't able to 
												use any items during the fight. 
												Characters that aren't rescued 
												will eventually become available 
												to you again, but they will have 
												lost every single item that they 
												were carrying. </p>
												<p align="left">Your adversaries 
												in Crimson Tears are varied as 
												far as their appearances and 
												intelligence goes. Guards and 
												soldier-types are the most 
												common enemies in the game, but 
												you'll also come up against a 
												number of different animals and 
												robots intent on killing you. 
												Most of the enemies in the game 
												are happy to engage you in 
												hand-to-hand fighting, but 
												you'll find that as you progress 
												they become increasingly 
												proficient at using guns, 
												flamethrowers, and such for 
												ranged attacks. The attacks, if 
												you see them coming, are 
												generally not too hard to avoid, 
												but since the game's camera 
												angle is fixed and is often 
												zoomed in too much to give you a 
												good view of the room you're 
												currently in, you'll often 
												sustain damage from enemies that 
												you didn't even know were there. 
												This is definitely the most 
												frustrating feature of Crimson 
												Tears, and as the rooms (and 
												your enemies' weapons) get 
												bigger later in the game, you're 
												really left with no choice but 
												to run around like a headless 
												chicken upon entering a 
												room--identifying and destroying 
												the enemies that would otherwise 
												cause you the most harm from 
												outside of your limited field of 
												vision. Crimson Tears' large 
												bosses are actually quite varied 
												and interesting, and they 
												undoubtedly boast the most 
												impressive visuals in the game. 
												Beating the bosses is generally 
												a lot easier if you're armed 
												with the correct weapon, so 
												you'll often just have to write 
												off your first encounter with 
												any given boss as a recon 
												mission. </p>
												<p align="left">Although the 
												bosses are definitely the most 
												impressive-looking things in 
												Crimson Tears, all of the cel-shaded 
												characters in the game are 
												actually quite easy on the eyes. 
												The enemies generally don't 
												appear to animate quite as well 
												as Amber, Kadie, or Tokio, but 
												this is because they don't have 
												nearly as many moves available 
												to them. Unfortunately, the 
												environments in the game aren't 
												quite as impressive as the 
												characters that frequent them; 
												it's not that they look bad or 
												anything, it's just that they're
												<i>so</i> repetitive. Sure, the 
												levels are randomly generated, 
												but all this actually means is 
												that you'll be fighting through 
												the same featureless rooms and 
												walking through the same bland 
												corridors in a different order 
												as you search for the key and 
												the teleporter that you need to 
												move to the next floor on your 
												way up to the boss. </p>
												<p align="left">The repetitive 
												nature of the action isn't 
												helped by the fact that, like 
												the bosses, many of the mazelike 
												levels in the game will need to 
												be attempted multiple times 
												before you beat them. More often 
												than not, this will simply be 
												because your characters haven't 
												leveled up sufficiently or 
												because you've run out of the 
												items that you need to heal 
												yourself. Stocking up on energy 
												boosts and other helpful items 
												isn't really an option either, 
												because you're limited to 
												carrying only five of any given 
												item. In fact, it's a lot easier 
												to accumulate money in Crimson 
												Tears than it is to spend it. 
												Although, in order to gain 
												access to better items via the 
												vendors in the hub area, you'll 
												need to donate some pretty 
												significant sums to an old guy 
												who's attempting to rebuild the 
												city following a large explosion 
												in the introduction sequence. 
												The hub area, unfortunately, 
												isn't nearly as interactive or 
												as expansive as it looks like it 
												might be the first time you 
												visit it, and the subquests you 
												get from the non-player 
												characters you talk to 
												invariably amount to little more 
												than brief trips to levels that 
												you've beaten previously when in 
												search of an item. </p>
												<p align="left">The sound 
												effects in Crimson Tears are, 
												unfortunately, just as 
												repetitive as the gameplay. 
												You'll hear the same noises 
												every time you hit an enemy, and 
												aside from weapon fire, the only 
												other sounds present are grunts 
												and groans from dying enemies 
												and from Tokio, if he's hit, as 
												well as screams and yelps of 
												pain from Amber and Kadie. 
												Occasionally, you'll also hear 
												an enemy shouting, &quot;they're over 
												there&quot; or &quot;don't let them get 
												away.&quot; </p>
												<p align="left">If the 
												repetitive nature of Crimson 
												Tears doesn't bother you, then 
												there's really no reason why you 
												won't derive many hours of 
												enjoyment from it. The game has 
												its share of ups and downs, but 
												if you're willing to overlook 
												the occasionally frustrating 
												fixed camera, it actually gets 
												better the more you play it, 
												just like the characters with 
												whom you'll be fighting. Crimson 
												Tears certainly isn't a game for 
												everyone, but if you're the type 
												of person that gets hooked on 
												character development in 
												combat-oriented games, it's at 
												least worth a rental. </div>
